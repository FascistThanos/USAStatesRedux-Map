 KSK_fascist1:0 "The Catholic Storm"
 KSK_fascist1_desc:0 "Gerald Burton Winrod is an outspoken supporter of Nazi Germany and a strong opponent of communism. He says that the only way to save the world from communism is to turn to fascism.

 KSK_fascist2:0 "Fund Legionaries"

 KSK_fascist3:0 "Politicize the Police"
 KSK_fascist3_desc:0 "We have the opportunity to follow in Germany's footsteps, establishing our own state secret police force. Additionally, allowing them into our ranks would aid our fight against partisans immensely."

 KSK_fascist8:0 "Expand the Role of the Church"
 KSK_fascist8_desc:0 "Finally, we must expand our military-industrial complex. Truly, it is the most important part of the state, and our path to victory. We must focus our efforts on modernizing our arms production and funding this vital organ of the state."
 KSK_fascist9:0 "Promote Catholic America"
 KSK_fascist9_desc:0 "The Defender has long been our chief newspaper, circulating our righteous message. Now, however, we must expand our audience to reach every part of our nation! We should appoint Gerald Winrod's son George to lead the effort and found the Defender Radio Station."

 KSK_eisenhower1:0 "We Like Ike"
 KSK_eisenhower1_desc:0 "Dwight Eisenhower is, to say the least, our finest commander. He is also an advocate for an infantry-centered military, supported by artillery barrage. Clearly, he is the man who knows best about these things, so we should follow his lead."
 KSK_eisenhower2:0 "The Grease Gun"
 KSK_eisenhower2_desc:0 "The M3A1 is a proposed submachine gun to phase out the Thompson. Firing the same .45 ACP cartridge as the thompson, the M3 is cheaper to produce and lighter. We should begin research immediately to further understand how this gun will perform in the field."
 KSK_eisenhower3:0 "Steel Rain"
 KSK_eisenhower3_desc:0 "Let our enemies fear the might of our artillery units! Improving our battlefield saturation capabilities will prove extremely useful in routing the enemy!"

 KSK_eisenhower6_desc:0 "Standardizing our weapons production means that we can produce our weapons faster and cheaper, which means we can overwhelm the enemy with our industry alone."
 KSK_eisenhower7:0 "Rigorous Training"

 KSK_chaffee1_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee Jr. is a Kansan calvalry officer, and a major proponent of armored warfare.

 KSK_army1:0 "Cross the Rockies"
 KSK_army1_desc:0 "The biggest obstacle to our expansion across the United States are the great Rocky Mountains. Our army simply will not be able to fight effectively, while our enemy will receive a massive home-field advantage. In order to counter this, it's time we established a mountaineer corps."
 KSK_army2:0 "Expand Our Doctrines"
 KSK_army2_desc:0 "Now that we have molded our equipment to match our doctrines, it is time to expound upon them. We will certainly find new doctrinal benefits if we continue."

 KSK_air3_desc:0 "The battlefield can be won by air superiority alone, and the best way to achieve this is with fighters."
 KSK_air4:0 "Escort Fighters"
 KSK_air4_desc:0 "While other nations may focus on small, agile fighters, we will focus our efforts on longe range, hard-hitting heavy fighters."
 KSK_air5:0 "Continue Bomber License"
 KSK_air5_desc:0 "Before the collapse, we had a contract with the federal government to produce several bombers. Now that the government no longer exists, there's no reason for us to stop this production. Let's put these bombers to good use!"
 KSK_air6:0 "CAS Effort"
 KSK_air6_desc:0 "Close Air Support can be the deciding factor in battle. Our infantry would certainly be grateful for air support, and it would allow us to make combined arms offensives."
 KSK_air7:0 "Strategic Bombers"
 KSK_air7_desc:0 "We can win wars without wasting a single infantryman. Bombs, not men, can cripple our enemies industry, destroying their ability to fight. We're going to bomb them back into the stone age!"
 KSK_air8:0 "Kansan Airborne"
 KSK_air8_desc:0 "If the air is our sea, then paratroopers will be our marines. Let our enemies fear the might of our airborne soldiers."
 KSK_air9:0 "Increased Fighter Production"
 KSK_air9_desc:0 "While it's easy to have visions of grandeur about air superiority, the truth is our air force is only as good as the workers who build our planes. The more planes we have in the air, the better."
 KSK_air10:0 "Ramp Up Bomber Production"
 KSK_air10_desc:0 "Imagine, our enemies think they are safe, when out of the skies roars the rolling thunder of our bombs. Their factories, leveled, their people, scattered. In one fell swoop, we have halted the enemy war machine. The only way this is possible, however is to produce enough bombers to cover the skies. We must ramp up our production immediately!"
 KSK_air11:0 "Amelia Earhart"
 KSK_air11_desc:0 "Amelia Earhart is one of Kansas' finest pilots, and perhaps one of the best in the world. Before the collapse, she had aspirations of circumnavigating the globe. However, her plans were stopped by the collapse. Instead, she has decided to become a pilot for our country."
 KSK_air12:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
 KSK_air12_desc:0 "The war in the air has changed forever, and lest we be left behind, we must refine our doctrines. What we teach our pilots will decide the fate of our air force, and our ability to win this vital war in the skies."
 KSK_conquest1:0 "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 KSK_conquest1_desc:0 "The time has come for us to expand our territory. Though our neighboring countries were once our fellow states, they are now unrecognizable masses of land ripe for the taking. We must be strong, be vigilant, if we are to fulfill our destiny."
 KSK_conquest2:0 "Fortify the Borders"
 KSK_conquest2_desc:0 "The first step to our conquests is to secure our frontiers. That starts with a line of bunkers that will protect us from foreign aggressors. These will be monuments to our strength, and protect us from any invader!"
 KSK_conquest3:0 "The Second Battle of Kansas City"
 KSK_conquest3_desc:0 "After the First Battle of Kansas City, our mission became clear- Secure Kansas City at all costs. Unifying the city would undoubtedly be a boost to our morale, as we have secured the eastern gate into our territory and squased the Missourian Bushwackers."
 KSK_conquest4:0 "Reclaim Denver"
 KSK_conquest4_desc:0 "Kansas territory once stretched all the way to Denver, and now is the time to regain our lost territory. Denver is the crown jewel of the rockies, and we must strike quickly if we are to secure it before the other vultures."
 KSK_conquest6:0 "Integrate Nebraska"
 KSK_conquest6_desc:0 "Though Nebraska might seem to hold little value for our state, it is always nice to expand your borders to provide buffer to your own territory. Besides, there is certainly industry in Nebraska that would be better served in the hands of Kansas."
 KSK_conquest5:0 "Take Oklahoma"
 KSK_conquest5_desc:0 "Expanding into Oklahoma is our best bet at containing Texas. The resources that we could gain there would certainly boost our aviation sector, and perhaps give us an armored fighting force to meet the Texans with. If we secure Oklahoma before they do, then we can rest easy that war will remain far from the Heart of Kansas."
 KSK_conquest7:0 "Unified Heartland"
 KSK_conquest7_desc:0 "After much fighting, the time has come to unify this broken heartland. For the most part, the occupied populace is at ease under Kansan rule, and they see no problem becoming part of a unified heartland. From now on, we no longer fight for Kansas, but for the entirety of Middle America."

missouri.1.t:0 "Missourian Victory!"
missouri.1.d:0 "Earlier today, border conflicts along the Kansas-Missouri border culminated in an all out skirmish between the two states. After intense fighting in Kansas City, the Missouri national guard was victorious! Jubilant soldiers gathered in front of the Power and Light building to organize a small parade, much to the dismay of Kansan spectators."
