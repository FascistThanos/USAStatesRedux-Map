#[TAG] Description
CAC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "California emerged as a regional power after the downfall of United States. The governor Frank Merriam with his cabinet immediately wrote the Californian Consitution in 1934. Frank Merriam then promised an emergency election to show the people that democracy had not yet died in North America. This gave him 1 year to stabilize California. The emergency term of Frank Merriam is coming to an end and the 1936 election is soon.. Will California die as the last bastion of democracy in America and fall to the ideals of fascism and communism? Or will Frank Merriam win the election once again and safeguard Californian democracy."
TXT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Texas is once again an independent nation. After the Great Collapse the flag that resides over Texas once again changes. 100 years ago Texas was in the same position. Now Texas stands stronger than when it was previously independent and can project power across the continent. Texas can follow democracy and restore order and stability in southern North America, create an empire to engulf the south, or follow the revolution and create a worker's union. With money coming in from oil exports and a patriotic people, Texas can choose it's path and rise to the occasion."
KSK_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The Great Collapse has severed the chains of the federal government from the great State of Kansas. Although our economy heavily relied on agricultural exports to the greater nation, now is the time to diversify our economy and grow to a regional power. Alf Landon is holding the reigns of the nation and many trust that he will steer Kansas on the right course. There are others, however, that believe Alf Landon is not the man to entrust the nation to. With the forces of Reverend Winrod and Earl Browder scheming to come to power in the nation, only time will tell if the Kansan state will succeed or fall to the wayside like the federal government that fathered it."
FLF_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Following the spirit bestowed upon is in 1861, we seceded from the Union after the Great Collapse. The State of Florida is in dire straits without the support of states around us but the nation will prevail. First, we must overcome the forces that seek to destabilize this great nation with a strong leader that will mold Florida to their vision and bring the Floridan people prosperity and happiness. Our ambitions across the Caribbean ocean will be realized and Florida will become a power to be reckoned with. Following our predecessors in the Confederacy, we will seek to reclaim Florida's dignity and honor."
ALA_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Alabama's largely agrarian nature has done it decently well while we were part of the Union. After the Union's collapse, however, we have been forced to reevaluate our economy. These economic forces have obligated us to choose between remaining largely agrarian or rapidly industrializing. On top of these economic woes, the Alabaman nation is plagued with issues of lynching, disenfranchisement, and segregation. These issues must be dealt with if Alabama is to succeed. Alabama is again faced with a crisis unseen since 1865 and will again persevere. Time's arrow marches on and we must act before the tide sweeps Alabama off of its feet."
GRN_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Greenland is now free from Denmark. After the Great Collapse, Denmark, which suffered from the economic impact of the United States' collapse had to free Greenland to save money. Now Greenland is free and has a choice to make. The chance has come for a new Greenland. Will Greenland stay with democracy, and protect the Arctic. Or will Greenland change its course, and go towards fascism, communism, or back to monarchism? Time will tell."
COC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The Centennial Republic stands alone. In the nation's darkest hour, the Great Experiment collapsed, leaving tremors across the continent that spilled over its borders. Problems that the Union failed to solve such as the dust bowl have continued to rack our nation with crop failures and death. Without federal aid, we must now figure out a way to fix all of these issues and gain equal footing among the new nations of the continent. Many seek to stabilize Colorado in their own way and soon their ideological differences will come to a head. The struggle for the Republic is soon to begin and we must persevere to become the crown jewel of the Rockies."
