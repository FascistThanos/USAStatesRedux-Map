 tex.5.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Proposes a Deal"
 tex.5.d:0 "A diplomat from The Republic of Texas has proposed a deal from their government. They've offered 4 civilian factories in return for the Eastern part of our country. While it is nothing but desert, it also contains most of our largest cities and population. The option weighs heavily on us, but we fear what the Texas will do if we decline their offer. We also have a threat to our West; California. Texas has also offered a guarantee of independence if we accept their offer."
 tex.5.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
 tex.5.b:0 "We would never give away our vitality."
 tex.6.t:0 "New Mexico has Declined"
 tex.6.d:0 "Despite our generous offer of support, the officials of New Mexico have declined our offer. We've tried to be gracious in our offer, but they still refuse to accept. While we did pledge to keep democracy pure, we will still make an excursion into Eastern New Mexico. They will not be able to defend, but they might attempt to. The occupation of Eastern New Mexico may be costly, but it's resources are worth the risk. We could always abort the border restoration, but if not, we need to do this."
 tex.6.b:0 "We should stop plans for the restoration"
 tex.6.a:0 "Occupy Eastern New Mexico"
 tex.7.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Offers Protection"
 tex.7.d:0 "Earlier today, we have recieved a diplomatic proposition from the Republic of Texas. They offer support in return for Northwest Colorado and Southeast Colorado. With our country split in two, they've offered military access. On top of that, they offer protection from California and Utah. The last thing they offer is 3 civilian factories. It would be hard to say no, but it may be necessary. If anything, it would be a blessing to get rid of the Rocky Mountains."
 tex.7.a:0 "Who would say no?"
 tex.7.b:0 "A generous offer, but no."
 tex.8.t:0 "Colorado has Declined"
 tex.8.d:0 "Although our offer was exceedingly generous, the government officials in Colorado have still said no. We have tried our best, but we've gone too far to be stopped now. The only option we have is force, which won't fair well for the democratic ideology. Nevertheless, we must make an incursion into central Colorado. The right to our former lands cannot be impeded. We must act quickly."
 tex.8.a:0 "Commence the attack."
 tex.9.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Offers Aid for the Panhandle"
 tex.9.d:0 "The government officials in the Republic of Texas have offered their support in return for the Oklahoma panhandle. In return for admittance into the United States, the Texans had to lose a lot of land. Now that the United States is no more, the Texans seek to reclaim it. The giant to our south already has a distain for the Oklahomans, so we should do our best to appease them. Their offer of civilian factories is the best that we can expect from them."
 tex.9.a:0 "We should appease them."
 tex.9.b:0 "It may have been theirs, but not anymore."
 tex.10.t:0 "The Oklahomans have said no"
 tex.10.d:0 "Despite our overwhelming power and our generous offer, the Oklahoman government has still denied our request. There is no way that they could have not seen the risks of the denial. We over power them significantly, and if they think that we will put up with the indignance shown by their government and people. We do not seek to remove them from the map, but we will only attempt to forcefully persuede them into giving us what we want."
 tex.10.a:0 "Begin the attack"
 tex.11.t:0 "Texas Demands Southeast Wyoming"
 tex.11.d:0 "Despite all of their territorial gains recently, the Repubic of Texas still hungers for their previous territory. They demand little from us, just Southeast Wyoming. If the Texans don't get what they want, we'll suffer the same fate as all of the other states that have denied them. While it's a small piece of land in the south, and it's only desert, it is representitive of our military strength. If we submit without a fight, we will be percieved as weak and we will be taken advantage of. We cannot allow that to happen."
 tex.11.a:0 "It's only desert anyway"
 tex.11.b:0 "We'll never give it up!"
 tex.12.t:0 "Wyoming has Refused!"
 tex.12.d:0 "Despite our overwhelming military strength, the government of Wyoming has denied us from occupying Southeast Wyoming. Although it's just desert, they seem to want to make a statement. Their economy is dirt compared to ours and they cannot withstand an attack. We should prepare to advance into Southeast Wyoming and occupy it permanently."
 tex.12.a:0 "Commence the attack"
 tex.13.t:0 "We are Victorious in Wyoming!"
 tex.13.d:0 "Following battles in Southern Wyoming, the Texan forces have overwhelmed the Wyomingite troops and maintained control of Southeastern Wyoming. The Wyoming forces surrendered before too much damage was done and we've maintained control of Southeastern Wyoming and they've offered to cede the land in return for the stopping of violent attacks on their troops. We've decided to honor their peace offering and settle for just Southeastern Wyoming."
 tex.13.a:0 "All that for a piece of sand"
 tex.14.t:0 "Demands from the Republic of Texas"
 tex.14.d:0 "The small piece of land in the southwest of Kansas is being demanded by the Republic of Texas. While it is not worth much, to cede it would be a sign of weakness in our foreign policy. To keep it could mean war with the Republic of Texas. Both options have negative outcomes, but the latter seems far worse and outcome than the former. Whatever is decided will change the future of Kansas as a nation and Kansans as a people."
 tex.14.a:0 "Hand it over"
 tex.14.b:0 "Do not fold."
 tex.15.t:0 "The Kansans Have Denied Us!"
 tex.15.d:0 "Following our demands of Southwest Kansas, the Kansas high command has flatly declined our 'request'. They do not seem to be changing their minds any time soon. Our only course of action would be to attack them. Hopefully, we can keep this to a simple skirmish on the border and not escalate it further. If not, we may have to march all the way to West Kansas City before they give up."
 tex.15.a:0 "They left us with no other option"
 tex.16.t:0 "A Texan Victory!"
 tex.16.d:0 "After many skirmishes on the Texan-Kansan border, the Texans have returned with news of victory. After many hours of rutheless fighting, the Kansan divisions surrendered, leaving Southwestern Kansas to us. The land may have little value, but the men in the land can be used successfully and the city enlatgened for people who would like to live in our glorious republic. This is a day to not be soon forgotten."
 tex.16.a:0 "A few more under our banner"
 tex.17.t:0 "The Old Republic of Texas Invites is to the Independent Republics of America"
 tex.17.d:0 "In an attempt to trifle with the plans of The New California Republic, The Old Texas Republic has invited us to their faction. They plan to create a coalition to stop the aggressive spread of California. With our help and many others, they may be able to achieve that goal. That only is if we do not want to align with the Californians. If we choose a side, there is a high probability that there will be war ahead of us, we just have to choose the winning side. Choosing incorrectly could spell the end of our nation."
 tex.17.a:0 "We're better off with them"
 tex.17.b:0 "We'd rather stay neutral for now"
 tex.18.t:0 "[From.GetName] has decided to remain neutral"
 tex.18.d:0 "Despite the current political climate, [From.GetName] has decided to remain neutral. It is unknown what will happen to them, but if they remain neutral for too long, they may be forced out of neutrality by the Californians. It is unknown where the Californians draw the line, but we do know that they will stop at nothing to get what they want. Nevada has suffered and lost their sovereignty to the Californians. Without us to back them up, who knows what will become of them. We can only hope that they do not get annexed in 'the name of the bear'"
 tex.18.a:0 "They will crumble alone."
 tex.19.t:0 "Civil War!"
 tex.19.d:0 "The time has come to overthrow our democratic government made by "the people". The people were not able to stop our inevitable overthrow. We have embroiled the country into civil war, so it will be our job to take them out of it. We must fight valliantly if we want to win and we must keep the war effort up. Our troops are not readily armed, but we must endure the fight anyway with the help of fascist nations around us."
 tex.19.a:0 "Now it begins"
 tex.20.t:0 "The War is Over!"
 tex.20.d:0 "Following the war with the democratic government of our nation, we need to begin to reconstruct. The war was costly, and it will take time to rebuild to our former glory and beyond. Many cities are damaged and Texan morale is at an all time low. We must do something quickly if we want to catch up with the other great nations of North America. Godspeed to the people who must go out and gather the masses. Some people may not take lightly to the new regime, but they will change their ways eventually and become more enlightened. Our path to glory is within reach!"
 tex.20.a:0 "Reconstruction Must Begin"
 tex.21.t:0 "The Path of the Revolution"
 tex.21.d:0 "Following the political revolution of our country, we need to choose who we will align with. Stalin's more direct approach creates a sphere of inferior nations that we will have control over. This may lead to insubordinate puppets and overall instability in the sphere. Trotsky's model follows more closely to the idea of a 'permanent revolution' which will eventually encompass the entire world. If we were to follow trotsky, the countries nearest to us may need some form of assistance in he conversion, but that would be very easily handeled. The path of the revolution depends on your choice, which will undoubtably be the smart decision."
 tex.21.a:0 "Stalin's model best fits the people of Texas."
 tex.21.b:0 "A collaboration of equals seems more fitting."
 tex.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] joins our faction"
 tex.22.d:0 "[From.GetName] sees that our morals are true and has joined us to support our preservation of America"
 tex.22.a:0 "Wonderful"
 tex.23.t:0 "[From.GetName] has denied our request"
 tex.23.d:0 "[From.GetName] has not seen the high probability of American Culture being eliminated by European powers."
 tex.23.a:0 "They will soon see."
 tex.25.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] has Offered the Partition of Colorado"
 tex.25.d:0 "Today we recieved a diplomatic inquiry about the partition of Colorado. If we were to accept, we could gain a significant amount of land from Colorado. They have also outlined a protection plan for Colorado in the event that they accept our offer. This clause obligates us to protect Colorado in the event of an invasion from any foreign power that seeks its land. They have explained that they will proceed without us, so this will be our only chance at strengthening ties with Texas and claiming land from the Coloradans."
 tex.25.a:0 "Prepare our troops and pledge their help."
 tex.25.b:0 "We shouldn't get involved in warmongering."
 tex.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] has Declined our Treaty"
 tex.26.d:0 "The diplomat sent to [FROM.GetName] has returned with some unfortunate news. [FROM.GetLeader] has decided that it's in their best interest to stay out of our conflict with Colorado. Their help was not necessary, but it would have made a ground invasion much easier and lowered the casualty count. Only time will tell if this was the correct decision, but for now we must prepare to send the demand to Colorado."
 tex.26.a:0 "Prepare to send the envoy."
 tex.26.b:0 "Maybe this isn't a worthwhile endeavor."
 tex.27.t:0 "Texan Demands"
 tex.27.d:0 "Recently, the diplomats from the Republic of Texas have been forming a coalition between Texas, New Mexico, and Utah on a partition of our lands. Without international support, it's unlikely that we'd survive a war against all three of our neighbors, but their demands are unreasonable and unjust. The decision must be made to fight until the last man in the treacherous Rockies or submit to our stronger neighbors."
 tex.27.a:0 "We cannot stand up to them, we must sign the treaty."
 tex.27.b:0 "We will take up arms and defend our nation!"
 tex.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Begun Mobilization"
 tex.28.d:0 "We have not received a response from the Coloradans and our diplomat has not returned. There seems to be an ammasing of able-bodied men in a conscription campaign. It seems that they're readying for war and our best option is to prepare as well."
 tex.28.a:0 "Begin moving troops into Colorado."
 tex.28.b:0 "We never expected them to stand against us. Back down."
 tex.29.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Calls us to arms!"
 tex.29.d:0 "Following a break down of negotiations between Texas and Colorado and the disappearance of a diplomat, there has been an official declaration of war. Texan troops are entering Colorado for a military invasion of the nation. Our signatory status on the treaty obligates us to join the war to assist the Texans."
 tex.29.a:0 "We will act in accordance to the treaty."
 tex.30.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Signed the Treaty"
 tex.30.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has signed the treaty outlining the partition of Colorado and it's subsequent protection from foreign threats. This deal will strengthen both of our nations politically on the international stage and increase our sphere of influence. We must soon prepare to send the demands."
 tex.30.a:0 "Prepare the envoy"
 tex.31.t:0 "Offer Surrender to the Coalition?"
 tex.31.d:0 "It has become apparent that we are fighting a losing battle. With the coalition ever encroaching on our last desperate defence, we must make a decision. Do we really fight until the last man and sacrifice them or do we surrender now and spare more bloodshed."
 tex.31.a:0 "We are clearly outgunned and outmatched, we must surrender."
 tex.31.b:0 "Our soldiers vowed to protect our country and that's what they'll do."
 tex.32.t:0 "The Surrender of Colorado"
 tex.32.d:0 "After a hard-fought war, the Coloradans have finally began to lay down their guns by order of the government. [FROM.GetLeader] has decided that now would be the time to surrender to the coalition and stop the bloodshed. It seems as if the army is reluctant to actually stop the fighting even though they are heavily outmatched and outnumbered. Our coalition is victorious."
 tex.32.a:0 "Divide the land in accordance to the treaty."
 tex.33.t:0 "Answering the Question of Expansion"
 tex.33.d:0 "To be completed (please notify a developer)"
 tex.33.a:0 "Expansion North is Our Best Option"
 tex.33.b:0 "Eastward to Riches!"
 tex.33.c:0 "We will Expand Westward as our Forefathers did."

 texasnews.5.t:0 "The Capitol Building Under the Control of Nationalists!"
 texasnews.5.d:0 " \n A few hours ago, the Capitol Building in Austin was taken over by nationalists that have begun to fight for their cause. The army was swayed beneath our noses and now we must pay the price. Only time will tell what these nationalist want, but it doesn't look good. We fear what will happen to Texas if the nationalists take charge, but only time will tell. A government should not be so unnaware of what's happening beneath them, but hindsight is 20/20. We can only hope that Texas does not lose it's way."

The president has stated that with the rising tension in the world, The Republic of Texas is forming a democratic coalition. If the coalition is sucessful, it could prove troublesome for aggressive ideologies. The hope of the coalition is to stop the spread of empires and keep their aggression in check. If they are sucessful, the coalition could mean the end of empires in North America all together. Whatever the outcome, let's hope it can quell the coming storm."

 texasnews.2.t:0 "The Republic of Texas Denounces the [CAC.GetName]!"
 texasnews.2.d:0 "In a speech held by James Allred, he has denounced Californian ideals. He believes that they're not following true to preserving peace and they should reduce their aggression. Whether he will take action against California and her people is yet to be seen. The Californian high command has yet to respond publicly, but if relations sour, it could lead to horrible outcomes. We can only hope to restore stability and peace in the Americas. In time, we will see."
