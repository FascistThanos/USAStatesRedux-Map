###Focuses
#Communist Tree
COC_the_colorado_springs_socialists:0 "The Colorado Springs Socialists"
COC_the_colorado_springs_socialists_desc:0 "In the former United States of America, societal discontent has been at an all-time high since the Great Collapse. There are few, if any, nations where instability has reached the heights seen in Colorado. With recent memories of crushed socialist movements such as the Columbine Mine massacre, socialists and communists alike are becoming more militant. Appeasement is far too little, too late; the memories of brutal suppression is forever burned in the people's memory. To ensure the safety of employees across our great nation of Colorado, extreme steps must be taken."
COC_secret_unions:0 "The Union Problem"
COC_secret_unions_desc:0 "The illegality of unions has resulted in the emergence of underground unions. These unions are quickly growing in popularity and participants. If we do not act soon, they may begin to press demands across the nation, and due to the sheer number of them, we will not be able to effectively deal with the issue. We need to come to a decision, and quickly as one organized strike could paralyze the economy in an instant."
COC_crack_down_left_wing_teachers:0 "Crack Down on Left Wing Teaching"
COC_crack_down_left_wing_teachers_desc:0 "Our country is being plagued by the infection of socialism and communism. The best way to root out the rot is to start with the youngest generation. Our schools are instilling socialist and communist values into our students by the will of teachers, this must stop. We need to assess every teacher on their ability to teach unencumbered by left wing thought. Any teacher found to be spewing left wing rhetoric will be terminated immediately, for the safety of our nation."
COC_deal_with_riots:0 "Deal with the Riots"
COC_deal_with_riots_desc:0 "Our recent actions have been staunchly opposed by the socialists, communists, and workers alike. It seems that our harsh actions towards these left wing groups has led to their support base growing due to the sympathy gained. Our actions were justified to deal with the impending threat but the people of this nation have failed to see that. This was not much of an issue as the moderates continued to live their lives normally without incedent. The issue, however, has begun to arise as more and more people have taken to the streets in protest, some even turning to riots."
COC_our_nation_in_crisis:0 "Our Nation in Crisis"
COC_our_nation_in_crisis_desc:0 "The battle for the soul of this very nation has begun. We must use unconventional tactics to beat our foe seeing as we are beginning on the back foot. Our will is superior to theirs as we fight for our own right to self determination and freedom from capitalist oppression. The fight will be long, it will be hard, but in the end we will prevail. For the future of Colorado we fight."
COC_clamp_down_fascism:0 "Eliminate Political Opposition"
COC_clamp_down_fascism_desc:0 "Due to the state of our nation, we cannot take any risks regarding political dissidents. If we are to win this war, we must present a united front against all those who stand against our cause. To achieve this, however, we must get rid of those who do not support us wholeheartedly. We will do whatever is necessary to win and it seems that a purge is one of those necessities."
COC_blood_of_union:0 "Fraternity of the Union"
COC_blood_of_union_desc:0 "Our allegiance to our union goes deeper than pure pragmatism. Our unions serve as families away from home, united by the lifeblood of comraderie, fraternity. We must call upon our brothers behind enemy lines to do their due diligence in the effort of this war. Even those who are unable to fight on the frontlines shall have a duty to this great nation, the workers will be suppressed no more."
COC_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms"
COC_call_to_arms_desc:0 "As the workers continue to be liberated across the nation, it's certain that those that are still oppressed are gaining hope. What we must do is call all of our brothers to pick up their guns and join our struggle. It'll be difficult for us to coordinate between the pockets of resistance, but if executed properly, we could disrupt supply lines and production. For one last push, we muster all of our strength."
COC_socialist_spirit_prevails:0 "The Socialist Spirit Prevails"
COC_socialist_spirit_prevails_desc:0 "As long as our citizens believe in the cause, the revolution will not fail. We must ensure that every soldier is willing to lay down their lives for the cause of socialism and equality within Colorado. Our nation's future depends on this fact. Fervor alone can do much more than any equipment. As long as we are believers, we will not lose. The socialist spirit will prevail."
COC_donation_of_arms:0 "Call Upon Our Citizens"
COC_donation_of_arms_desc:0 "Due to the second amendment to the old Constitution, many citizens in our nation own firearms. While we do not currently have a consensus on whether or not this fact will be changing after the war, now is the time to act. We must call upon every citizen of our nation to donate their firearms in an effort to fill our ranks with armed soldiers and increase the chance of our success."
COC_gender_equality:0 "True Gender Equality"
COC_gender_equality_desc:0 "In order for our ideals to truely be realized, we must allow women equal rights and equal opportunities. This, of course, means equal duty to the nation's armed forces. It's projected that conscripting women alongside men could bolster our ranks and fill our reserves. The women of this nation know their duty and many are eager to fulfill it. We must put out the call for women to enlist and fight for what they believe in. We must all fight for true gender equality."
COC_our_nation_at_rest:0 "Our Nation at Rest"
COC_our_nation_at_rest_desc:0 "The battle for the nation is over, and we are the victors. Enemies of socialism in Colorado have failed to stop our rise and we now can reform the nation into a more advanced society. Despite our initial disadvantage we have prevailed in our righteous fight. Our spirit has prevailed and we have proven that we will not be giving up Colorado easily. The fight was long, the fight was hard, but we have managed to escape the yoke of capitalism. We will now march triumphantly into the future as we bring equality and happiness to our citizens. Long live Colorado!"
#Fascism Tree
COC_assassinate_RLC:0 "Assassinate Governor Johnson"
COC_assassinate_RLC_desc:0 "It has been shown through the Great Collapse that democratic processes are not suitable for dealing with crises. In order to bring Colorado out of this great catastrophe stronger than before, we need a strong centralized government. Forces lurking in the darkness have arranged for the assassination of [ROOT.GetLeader] in order to bring about the political climate required for the citizens to be accepting of a political change so drastic. Morning will come."
COC_cleanse_the_nation:0 "Cleanse the Nation"
COC_cleanse_the_nation_desc:0 "In order to further the political situation in our favor, we must cleanse the nation. There are enemies everywhere and the only way to bring strength to Colorado is to find them and eliminate them. We will make our enemies "disappear" and use their absence to our advantage. With our cause just and god on our side, we will prevail in this conflict. We will bring Colorado to the forefront of the region, then the continent."
COC_seep_into_education:0 "Infiltrate Education"
COC_seep_into_education_desc:0 "Changing the minds of a nation starts at the bottom. In order to bring about the order that we want within the country, we must begin at the roots of ideological thought, education. If we begin at a very young age, we can churn out as many people as we need to wholeheartedly believe in our cause and be willing to lay down their lives for our victory. Today they learn what's right and what's wrong, tomorrow they learn to use a weapon."
COC_mil_secondary_school:0 "Secondary Military Schooling"
COC_mil_secondary_school_desc:0 "Our nation is woefully unprepared for an armed conflict. To solve this problem, we must expand secondary school curriculum to include military training. These men and boys will not be enlisted immediately, but their training will certainly help in the case of an armed conflict that involves general mobilization. It also will be beneficial to have this training as keeping control of our territories will prove to be much harder when you have trained militias throughout the nation."
COC_form_paramilitaries:0 "The Formation of Paramilitary Groups"
COC_form_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Inspired by our influence in government, groups across the nation have begun forming. These groups are currently under watch from the government and seem to be armed paramilitary forces. The government doesn't know the full motives or story behind these groups, but it's becoming increasingly clear that they are fascists. The formation of these groups shows us that we have support far across the nation and our struggle may be close to the end. Perhaps we could harness the power of these groups and use them to our advantage..."
COC_organize_paramilitaries:0 "Organize the Paramilitaries"
COC_organize_paramilitaries_desc:0 "As our plans commence, we have realized that we are in need of an army. In the event that the Colorado Army National Guard stays true to their duty to protect the government, we will need a force to combat them. While this scenario is unlikely, an army at the ready is never something to hastily discard.

COC_state_forestry_act:0 "The Colorado State Forestry Act"
COC_state_forestry_act_desc:0 "Among the plans for solving the issue of the Dustbowl was the State Forestry Act. This act would serve to subsidize tree planting in certain areas to negate the effects of the Dustbowl. The theory is that the trees will prevent further erosion by holding the soil in place with its roots. On top of this, the already loose soil that isn't held down will be caught by the trees instead of flowing freely for miles. The act is relatively cheap and will improve the lives of many."

This will allow these farmers to start a new life in a different part of the nation as well as alleviate the issue that started the problem in the first place, over-farming. By resettling these farmers the land will begin to replenish and stabilize over time, which will eventually allow people to farm there again.

With recent events, this dilemma is essentially thrust upon us, with good points on either side. The question now is, long game, or investing in mining in Telluride, or instant gratification, redirecting funding and investments."

Obviously, in this day and age, that’s quite a necessity for a great nation, thus we have some catching up to do, and where better for a vast airport than our capital, Denver. The question now is whether we prioritize in our planning the civil aspects or the military aspects of the field."

coc.3.b:0 "We should begin with military use planning."
coc.4.t:0 "Civilian Plans for Denver International Airport"

Now the question arises: “What do we do with the airport?” Do we, A, prioritize trade via air, or B, attract tourism and immigration? There is a radical option C, however, which is simply, “Why not both?”"

Unfortunately, Texas happens to have an air force, which, as seen in the Great War, can absolutely turn the tide, yet we don’t. Therefore, DIA must be prioritized, for our sake and continued survival, for military use. However, there’s a bit of indecision as to what our focus should be, whether pilot training so we have the best in the skies, or on sortie efficiency with good ground crews to keep the flyboys in the sky. There is, also, of course, the option to try both."

This, of course, caused quite a bit of alarm in the government as the recent issues has had everyone on edge. It's still unknown who, but someone called in the national guard. By 1:00PM the protesters became more violent as the arrival of the national guard proved the government's inability to cooperate. Soon the protest descended into a bloody riot with buildings being vandalized, shops being broken into and set on fire, and innocent bystanders being harmed. A group of rioters began pushing ever closer to the line of national guardsmen who were protecting the capital, with each step making them more uneasy. They demanded that the rioters stand down and keep their distance to no avail. Backed into a corner and fearing for their lives, the soldiers protecting the capital opened fire. Before the hour was out, there were bodies dotting the landscape around the capitol building as the city was deafeningly silent. After the bodies had been cleared out, the government issued a stay-at-home order. The national guard would remain in the capital. Colorado weeps for the fallen."

As time went on the protesters became increasingly aggressive as many began to shout, chant, and throw rocks at the national guard stationed across the area. It was then, at 5:37PM when, for the second time in less than a year, shots were fired at the capitol building. This time, however, it was not the national guard who fired the first shot. As if they were organized by a central planning force, the protesters began taking cover and firing at the national guard. Backup was called, and by 6:13 PM they had arrived.

coloradonews.2.t:0 "Standoff in the Rockies"
coloradonews.2.d:0 "Flying under the radar of the greater world, the last few weeks has seen tension built up in the Rockies. The hostilities between [COC.GetNameDef] and [TXT.GetNameDef] have been bubbling under the surface since the acts of aggression towards New Mexico and Oklahoma. These unspoken hostilites came to a head yesterday as Texan officials announced their land reclaimation initiative. Coloradan politicians and citizens alike know what the Texan government has in mind and despite the recent upsets in stability within their nation, Coloradans have set aside their differences to stand in solidarity against the Texan threat. Many leaders in the region have been silent on the issue, but it's unlikely that these nations will be able to escape the orbit of this conflict and continue unscathed. Only time will tell what's to come, but for now, the region holds its breath."
coloradonews.2.a:0 "We will watch with great interest."
coloradonews.2.b:0 "Surely the world won't sit idly by?"
coloradonews.2.c:0 "Intervetion is futile, it's clear who will prevail."
coloradonews.3.t:0 "The Great Rockies War"
coloradonews.3.d:0 "Over the past 22 weeks there were negotiations regarding the Coloradan Crisis, yet an agreement has failed to be made. However, it appears that today's tensions between [COC.GetNameDef] and its supporters, as well as [TXT.GetNameDef] and its supporters, have reached a boiling point. We have recieved reports of firefights breaking out across the shared borders of the nations interested in the crisis. The goals of the nations have yet to be disclosed but as the war goes on it becomes more likely that these goals will be announced. Citizens across the region despair as their sons, brothers, and husbands are sent off to fight in a war. One thing is for certain, however; whoever prevails in this conflict will dictate the politics and events in the region for years to come. As time marches on, the North American continent trembles as the drums of war ripple from its center."
coloradonews.3.a:0 "All this over some mountains?"
coloradonews.3.b:0 "We will fight for our nation's soul."
coloradonews.3.c:0 "They will collapse under our might."
coloradonews.4.t:0 "Colorado Wins the Great Rockies War!"
coloradonews.4.d:0 "Celebrations erupted across the nations in the Colorado Coalition today as it's been announced that peace has been achieved in the region. Against the odds of many speculators, the Coloradans have managed to hold their own against the Texan army. Peace is being ratified by combatant nations as this news reaches every corner of the globe. The region will no doubt be shaped by this development for the forseeable future. For now, the region can finally rest before the next inevitable conflict. Victorious nations will have to be wary of complacency that grips victors of great wars to avoid falling to the wayside and falling to false security that will bring everything they fought for down. The defeated nations, however, are treading a very fine line to avoid their own destruction. Powerful forces within their country will have to be watched carefully as this failure in war will surely cause domestic turmoil. For now at least, the region can once again breathe in peace."
coloradonews.4.a:0 "Peace at last."
coloradonews.5.t:0 "Texas Wins the Great Rockies War!"
coloradonews.5.d:0 "To the surprise of no one, the Texan army has marched triumphantly into Colorado and their government, as well as their allies, has been forced into a humiliating peace arrangement. The Texan claims have been validated and it's unknown yet if they will continue in their ambitions to pacify their greater region. It is known, however, that the Rocky mountain region is now uncontested for Texas and its allies. This is, of course, if their alliance manages to stay together. An alliance formed by opportunity and convenience is never guaranteed, and for Texas' hegemony to remain, the faction must also do so. We'll have to keep an eye on the region in the future as Texas may form new enemies in the wake of their victory. For now though, the region is at peace and citizens are celebrating a return to some sort of normalcy as their loved ones return home."
coloradonews.5.a:0 "Peace at last."
coloradonews.6.t:0 "Ceasefire in the Rockies!"
coloradonews.6.d:0 "News broke from the Rocky Mountains today as nations across the region are signing peace agreements. It's yet to be determined how the final peace will look, but the balance of power has certainly shifted within the region. We don't know how long this unsteady peace will last but it's put an end to all of the bloodshed experienced in the last months. The armistice includes transfer of claimed territories that are occupied by their claimants or their allies, official peace between combatant nations, and a truce between the two sides. It's unlikely that the military alliances formed during the crisis will fade any time soon due to the continued tension in the region but these alliances are anything but stable. If these alliances manage to stay together, however, it would leave two significant power blocks in the region that would be poised to attack on another at any given moment. One thing is for certain, though. Any nation wanting to keep its stability secure would not dare set foot in the Rocky Mountains."
coloradonews.6.a:0 "The region is finally at peace."
#Country Events
cocrisis.1.t:0 "The Coloradan Crisis"
cocrisis.1.d:0 "Our recent ambitions to restore our previously claimed borders has brought us into conflict. This, of course, was expected and welcomed as it furthered our territorial goals and served as a threat for nations such as [CAC.GetNameDef]. Despite our preparations and willingness for conflict, we have recently encountered an unexpected contender and threat. Although their population is about five and a half times smaller than ours, Colorado has put up an unexpected level of resistance. This is likely due to the location of the land we've demanded, seeing as it would split their nation in half and leave them vulnerable to attack from the west. On top of that, we would be seizing much of the valuable natural resources that has been fueling their economy for the past few years. It's unknown how long they will put up this façade, but one thing is for certain: we cannot back down now."
cocrisis.1.a:0 "Let the games begin."
cocrisis.2.t:0 "The Battle for the Heartland"
cocrisis.2.d:0 "As expected, the Texans have begun to rise in the south. Their recent actions against Oklahoma and New Mexico have confirmed our fears of their push northward. Now that they have a substantial border shared with us, they seek to reclaim lands once lost. Despite their agreements with the federal government to join the Union, the gluttons to the south hunger for more land, despite being the largest state at the collapse of the Union. Brothers and sisters of Colorado, we must stand together once and for all to defend this great nation, or die trying. The livelihood of this nation is at stake and we must take all measures necessary to insure that our nation remains free and sovereign, unencumbered by the chasm that the Texans plan to draw through this great nation."
cocrisis.2.a:0 "Our nation is at stake."
cocrisis.3.t:0 "An Offer From Colorado"
cocrisis.3.d:0 "We have recently recieved an offer from Coloradan diplomats regarding our interest in the Colorado Crisis. What they're offering is pretty simple; neutrality for payment. If we were to accept this deal, we will remain neutral for the rest of the conflict and at the conflict's conclusion we would recieve payment from the Coloradan government. While this is a pretty beneficial deal, we might want to consider our other options as we may be able to spark a bidding war for our allegience in this conflict. If we play our cards right, the Utahan economy could boom."
cocrisis.3.a:0 "It's too good a deal to pass up."
cocrisis.3.b:0 "Neutrality is not an option."
cocrisis.4.t:0 "A Utahan Opportunity"
cocrisis.4.d:0 "In an interesting development following the opening of the crisis, Utahan diplomats have rejected Colorado's pleading for neutrality. While this doesn't guarantee that Utah will join our side, it does mean that they are open to more talks about the situation in Colorado. If we so choose, we can offer them the western portion of Colorado, colloquially known as 'the Great West'. Offering them this would certainly sway their opinion in favor of joining the Texan cause. This obligation could, of course, be ignored, but we will cross that bridge when we come to it."
cocrisis.4.a:0 "We will make the offer."
cocrisis.4.b:0 "We don't work with opportunists."
cocrisis.5.t:0 "A Response From Utah"
cocrisis.5.d:0 "In an unfortunate blow to our efforts against the Texan threat, Utahan officials have decided against our 'Payment for Neutrality' deal. It's still unknown if Utah simply doesn't want to take Coloradan money of if their goals are more nefarious. At this point we can only hope that they do not choose to side with Texas. In our time of need, we have been betrayed by our mountainous brothers. We must fight on for the soul of the nation."
cocrisis.5.a:0 "We will not soon forget."
cocrisis.5.b:0 "Perhaps throw more money at them?"
cocrisis.6.t:0 "Utah Secured"
cocrisis.6.d:0 "We have recently received word that diplomatic channels between Colorado and Utah have broken down. It seems that their relationship is over and they are all but sure to invade along with us. This is a great victory in our aims to reunite what was once ours and this will greatly increase our odds of achieving that goal. Our fight is not over yet, but with this development it will be much easier. Send a letter of congratulations to Utah and prepare futher cooperation militarily with them."
cocrisis.6.a:0 "A great day!"
cocrisis.7.t:0 "An Offer From Texas"
cocrisis.7.d:0 "It seems our gamble against Colorado has paid off and our theories were correct. We have recieved communication from Texan diplomats offering 'The Great West' in Colorado in exchange for our loyalty. Our position in this crisis is one of opportunity, and when one presents itself we should take it. We could, of course, wait Colorado out for a better deal, seeing as that would require the loss of 0 Utahan lives, but taking a deal from Colorado is risky. Should Colorado lose the war, it would make our deal worthless due to the fact that they'd be unable to pay their debts. On top of this, it would sour relations with a Texan government that is much stronger than it is now. We must carefully weigh our options."
cocrisis.7.a:0 "Texas' offer is the safest route."
cocrisis.7.b:0 "We will not stand with warmongers."
cocrisis.8.t:0 "Another Offer From Colorado"
cocrisis.8.d:0 "It seems our diplomatic maneuvering has given us even more opportunity. The offers from Texas have garnered the attention of Colorado who offers us even more economic incentive after the crisis is over. We don't know how far they're willing to go, but we can likely push our luck and see what Texas has to offer. We are now walking the fine line of opportunism, but if we do this right, it will propel Utah into prosperity."
cocrisis.8.a:0 "Texas won't be happy about this, but it's too good to pass up."
cocrisis.8.b:0 "We have already made our choice."
cocrisis.9.t:0 "Utah is Lost"
cocrisis.9.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we were unable to sway the people and politicians of Utah. The diplomatic channels between the Utahan government and ours have been severed and they have pledged their allegiance to Texas. Any further diplomacy that we would attempt would have to be through the Texan government, which would not allow for us to make them any more offers. This is a huge blow to our effort in this crisis, but we must fight anyway. Call the generals for an emergency meeting to plan the Utahan defense initiative."
cocrisis.9.a:0 "Has god abandoned us?"
cocrisis.10.t:0 "Utah's Shifting Allegiance"
cocrisis.10.d:0 "It seems that Utah isn't as secure as we previously thought. It seems that despite their alignment with us previously, they have now entered talks with Colorado about staying neutral. We don't know the details of this agreement, but it surely puts a damper on our efforts to claim the land owed to us. It seems we have two choices here; we can attempt to bargain for their loyalty, which has been proven to be shaky, or we can decide to cut our losses and not waste any more time. Neither option is exactly thrilling, but we must make a choice."
cocrisis.10.a:0 "Reopen negotiations with Utah"
cocrisis.10.b:0 "They aren't worth our time."
cocrisis.11.t:0 "Utah Will Not Fight"
cocrisis.11.d:0 "Our diplomacy has prevailed today brothers and sisters! We have recieved news that Texas has abandoned their goals to bring Utah into their gang of international bullies. Our nation will rejoice with the promise that the west is secure today! Our struggle against the warmongering Texans is not over, but this is surely a step in the right direction. We can now focus more on our defenses on other borders of our nation. Morning will come!"
cocrisis.11.a:0 "Victory is close!"
cocrisis.12.t:0 "Texas Makes Another Offer"
cocrisis.12.d:0 "Following our recent talks with Colorado, we have been approached by Texas. Theirs is truly a Texas sized offer and it would be foolish to dismiss it without thought. Taking a page out of Colorado's book, they're offering us the previous land arrangement on top of economic incentives. These economic incentives are not as great as Colorado's but it might be made up for by the gain in land. Of course we'd have to factor in the possible deaths of Utahan soldiers in this equation, but a choice must be made."
cocrisis.12.a:0 "It's too good an offer to pass up"
cocrisis.12.b:0 "Our minds are made up."
cocrisis.13.t:0 "Utah Announced Neutrality"
cocrisis.13.d:0 "In a foolish and annoying move, Utah has announced that it will remain militarily neutral in the Colorado Crisis. We don't know what kind of deal they struck with Coloradan diplomats, but it's certain that they had something to do with this. Utahan diplomats have left Austin and it seems that there will be no way to recover our opportunity to get them on our side in the war. As unfortunate as it is, we must move on to the other actors in this crisis to leverage a comfortable position. Colorado must be partitioned."
cocrisis.13.a:0 "They wouldn't have been much help anyway."
cocrisis.14.t:0 "Utah Shifts Once More"
cocrisis.14.d:0 "Just when we thought we had secured Utah's allegiance, they have decided to make another deal with the Texan government. Their inability to make up their minds has made us uneasy to continue moving forward with them, but their position in the west has continued to force our hand. We cannot keep this up for much longer. Although we must be wary of the Utahan government and their schemes, we still are forced to make a choice on whether or not to negotiate with them further."
cocrisis.14.a:0 "We will give them one last offer."
cocrisis.14.b:0 "They have burned the last bridge."
cocrisis.15.t:0 "Colorado's Final Offer"
cocrisis.15.d:0 "It seems that our strategy has bore fruit. Colorado has made us one final offer after our recent talks with Texas. The amount that Colorado has offered is immense and if we were to accept this offer, Texas would likely not attempt a counteroffer. We're in a very advantageous position right now and all that's left is to choose which side we think has the highest odds of winning. We are opportunists, after all."
cocrisis.15.a:0 "Colorado has bought our neutrality."
cocrisis.15.b:0 "Texas' offer is preferable."
cocrisis.16.t:0 "Coloradan Diplomat Arrives"
cocrisis.16.d:0 "Upon the outbreak of the Colorado Crisis, a diplomat from Colorado has arrived in Western Albuquerque. We have been offered a great proposition. Our international humiliation against Texas has caught the eye of Colorado, and they are offering to right that wrong. They promise us that if we join their side, we will regain our lost territories in the peace negotiations. Such a claim must be backed up by military, but we're in a position where we have nothing to lose. Our land was unfairly stripped from us but it seems we may just have the perfect opportunity to get it back."
cocrisis.16.a:0 "We have nothing to lose, prepare the military."
cocrisis.16.b:0 "We stand no chance against the Texan giant."
cocrisis.17.t:0 "New Mexico Joins Arms"
cocrisis.17.d:0 "Our diplomat successfully made it to Western Albuquerque and brokered an agreement between our two nations. New Mexico will be joining our side in this crisis in exchange for a guarantee that their land is returned to them. This of course, is great for us as it adds a considerable number of men to our ranks as well as serving a dual purpose. If we fulfill our goals, Texas will grow much weaker and be unable to contest us in the future. Together with New Mexico, we are one step closer to defeating the Texan threat once and for all."
cocrisis.17.a:0 "Send them a letter of thanks."
cocrisis.18.t:0 "New Mexico Joins Colorado"
cocrisis.18.d:0 "It seems that New Mexico has not forgotten our recent history. They have declared that they will be supporting Colorado in the crisis, likely with the aim of retrieving their recently lost territory. It unfortunately opens another front but allows us for greater political control over New Mexico when we win, essentially making it a puppet state. Their cowardess will not be awarded and we will prove, once again, that we are the superior military force."
cocrisis.18.a:0 "Their punishment will be served soon enough."
cocrisis.19.t:0 "New Mexico Remains Neutral"
cocrisis.19.d:0 "Despite the inflamed public opinion and our nation's similarities, New Mexico has decided to remain neutral in the crisis. Their cowardly government has decided to sit idly by while our nation could very possibly suffer the same fate as theirs. We have offered that their land be returned and greater cooperation between our nations and yet they have still refused. They have missed out on their opportunity and when we win, a friendly government will be set up in Eastern New Mexico that opposes the cowardly regime that once resided there."
cocrisis.19.a:0 "They are on the wrong side of history."
cocrisis.20.t:0 "New Mexico Fears Our Might!"
cocrisis.20.d:0 "It has become apparent that our recent incursions into New Mexico has taught them a lesson. Despite the offers from Colorado to return their old lands, New Mexico has stood unevenly on the fence. It seems, however, that recently the New Mexican government has decided against joining forces with Colorado in a foolish attempt to fight us. In a public speech, one of the main reasons sighted was the vast military disparity between the nations. This is a great win for our cause and will allow us to focus more troops on Colorado."
cocrisis.20.a:0 "Cowards tremble at our might."
cocrisis.20.b:0 "This spells opportunity for cooperation."
cocrisis.21.t:0 "Diplomat from Texas Arrives"
cocrisis.21.d:0 "After our recent announcement of neutrality, a diplomat from Texas has arrived with a pleasant surprise. The government of Texas has given a peace offering in the form of Coloradan land. They have promised that, in return for our continued neutrality, we will receive the southwestern region of Colorado after their victory in the war. They have made it explicitely clear that this is a no-strings-attatched deal and it's simply meant as a peace offering. If they hope to improve relations between our nations, this is the way to do it."
cocrisis.21.a:0 "A welcome surprise."
cocrisis.22.t:0 "The Panhandle Issue"
cocrisis.22.d:0 "Citing our recent loss of the Oklahoman Panhandle, a diplomat from Colorado has arrived in Oklahoma City seeking our support in the crisis. They offer us the return of our lost land and reparations from Texas if we join them. The move would be risky and certainly requires a lot of deliberate thinking as making the wrong choice could end the sovereignty of our nation. If we were to join the coalition against Texas, however, it would increase the legitimacy of our government in the eyes of the people. We have a difficult decision to make."
cocrisis.22.a:0 "We will avenge our past losses."
cocrisis.22.b:0 "Abandon this fool's errand."
cocrisis.23.t:0 "Oklahoma Stands Against Texas"
cocrisis.23.d:0 "Fantastic news has arrived from Oklahoma City today; the Oklahoman army will stand together with us. They are excited to reclaim their territory and undo the humiliation that they've suffered at the hands of Texas. The increasing number of nations that support us in this crisis is truly inspiring. There's a lot of work left to be done but today we must celebrate! We shall make a toast to our new Oklahoman friends!"
cocrisis.23.a:0 "A great day for our nation."
cocrisis.24.t:0 "Oklahoma Shows Its Cowardess"
cocrisis.24.d:0 "We have recieved unfortunate news from our diplomat in Oklahoma City today. The nation of Oklahoma and its army will not take up arms against Texas. Their excuses do not convince us for we have no choice but to fight. When we win our fight, Oklahoma and its people will reap none of the benefits. The act of betrayal shown today will burn in our memories far into the future. Those who are not with us are against us in the fight for our right to existence."
cocrisis.24.a:0 "They are pathetic."
cocrisis.25.t:0 "Oklahoma is Defiant"
cocrisis.25.d:0 "Despite our undeniable proof that our army is superior to that of Oklahoma, their government has done the unthinkable. Earlier today they've given the announcement that they will be supporting Colorado in the coming crisis which leaves us with a larger front to deal with. Their acts of disrespect will not go unpunished and we will soon march into Oklahoma City, once again victorious over their measly army."
cocrisis.25.a:0 "Justice will come soon."
cocrisis.26.t:0 "Oklahoma Knows Its Place"
cocrisis.26.d:0 "Earlier today we have received word that, despite Colorado's best efforts, Oklahoma will be remaining neutral in this conflict. It seems that our incursions into their lands to seize the Panhandle has shown them their place. They are clear on the might of the Texas military and our stance on the matter. Today is a good day to be Texan and the cards are falling into place. If this keeps up, Colorado will have no chance in this conflict."
cocrisis.26.a:0 "We will keep an eye on them."
cocrisis.26.b:0 "Demand their fealty or it is war."
cocrisis.27.t:0 "Texas Demands Our Support"
cocrisis.27.d:0 "In a horrifying and disrespectful move, Austin has demanded that we support their war effort with material and men. This goes against our best efforts to remain neutral and unfortunately forces us to make a choice. We can stand firm on our neutrality and call Texas' bluff, or we can cowtow to Austin. Should we reaffirm our neutrality, we would surely have to be prepared for whatever comes our way, likely a military intervention."
cocrisis.27.a:0 "We are chained by our southern neighbor."
cocrisis.27.b:0 "If it is war they want..."
cocrisis.28.t:0 "Oklahoma Bends to Our Will"
cocrisis.28.d:0 "In a mighty show of force, we have made the Oklahoman government retract their statement of neutrality in the crisis. While their army is not particularly strong, it serves as backfill for our ranks. On top of this, it serves as a demoralizing tool against the Coloradan effort as they see more nations slip from their grasp. The odds continue to sway in our favor."
cocrisis.28.a:0 "A wise move."
cocrisis.29.t:0 "Oklahoma Stands Firm"
cocrisis.29.d:0 "In an outrageous and foolish move, the Oklahoman government has remained firm on their stance in the crisis. Their neutrality, they say, is the only thing that keeps their nation free, sovereign, and stable. It seems that we will have to take matters into our own hands and put an end to all of those things. A swift invasion of Oklahoma is the only solution that guarantees our interests stay secure in our northern neighbor before they get any radical ideas. Soon they will learn of their mistakes."
cocrisis.29.a:0 "They have brought this upon themselves."
cocrisis.29.b:0 "They've called our bluff, stand down."
cocrisis.30.t:0 "Oklahoma Goes Back on its Neutrality"
cocrisis.30.d:0 "In a shocking development in Oklahoma City, officials have announced that they will be supporting the Texas campaign against our people. It's currently unknown if they have struck a deal of some kind but one thing is for certain; this is bad news. While their army is not particularly large or advanced, the Oklahoman betrayal is starting to seep into the minds of Coloradans. Morale has begun to slip as fearmongers rile up the population. If many more nations act against us, we may be left alone."
cocrisis.30.a:0 "We pray for our survival."
cocrisis.31.t:0 "The Coloradan Proposal"
cocrisis.31.d:0 "Following our recent loss of Southwest Kansas, the Coloradan government has approached us with an offer. They propose that we join their side in the crisis in return for our lands in Southwest Kansas back. We have a difficult decision to make as this may be our only chance at reclaiming our territory. If the Texan Coalition wins, we would face impossible odds for the return of our land."
cocrisis.31.a:0 "They drive a hard bargain."
cocrisis.31.b:0 "Why would we risk our sovereignty for a useless piece of land?"
cocrisis.32.t:0 "Kansas Accepts Our Proposal"
cocrisis.32.d:0 "We have recently received the news that the Kansan government has agreed to our proposal over Southwest Kansas. This comes as great news with the crisis in full swing. Another supporter on our side should make Texas think twice about their outrageous demands. The triumph of our armies against Texas will go down in history as one of the greatest military cooperations in North America. Texas has made a grave mistake."
cocrisis.32.a:0 "It seems Austin has made too many enemies."
cocrisis.33.t:0 "Kansas Refuses the Proposal"
cocrisis.33.d:0 "In a shocking and foolish move, the Kansan government has refused to sign our treaty. While the treaty would have caused the return of their lost lands in Southwest Kansas, they have, for some reason, refused. It's unknown if they have made an agreement with the Texan government or if they are simply living in fear of the Texan army, but one thing is for certain; Kansas is living on borrowed time."
cocrisis.33.a:0 "Those cowards should stand and fight!"
cocrisis.34.t:0 "Kansas Backs Colorado"
cocrisis.34.d:0 "In a foolish and disrespectful move, the Kansan government has decided to back the Coloradan government in this unfolding crisis. There is no doubt that our acquisition of Southwest Kansas has swayed this decision, but nevertheless we will prevail. The plains of the Midwest do nothing to naturally advantage Kansas, so their brief interruption on Colorado's behalf will amount to nothing. Those that stand against us will crumble under their own weight as Texan might grows stronger."
cocrisis.34.a:0 "Those who stand against us will fall."
cocrisis.35.t:0 "Kansas Stays Neutral"
cocrisis.35.d:0 "In an announcement today, [KSK.GetLeader] has stated that the Kansan people will not involve themselves in this crisis. On their part, this is a wise move seeing as our military might is unparalleled in the region. This has surely demoralized the Coloradans and will serve as even more ammunition in our diplomatic warfare. Let us hope that we can solve this situation diplomatically rather than on the battlefield; there's no point in proving what's already common knowledge."
cocrisis.35.a:0 "They made the right choice."
cocrisis.36.t:0 "Texas Offers a Trade"
cocrisis.36.d:0 "In a move that was entirely expected, the Texan government has staked their claims on Southwest Kansas. In a move that was entirely unexpected, though, they've offered us a trade deal for the land. They have offered us a puppet government in the remains of the Coloradan state in return for Southwest Kansas. Of course we could do whatever we wanted to the government that they give us in Colorado, including annexing them. We would have to keep this deal a secret, of course. It could, however, cause potential backlash from the Kansan populace that we would have to endure for the greater good. We must weigh our options."
cocrisis.36.a:0 "Cheers to diplomacy!"
cocrisis.36.b:0 "What does Colorado have to offer?" #Only if Oklahoma remains neutral/joins Texas
cocrisis.36.c:0 "They'll have to pry Southwest Kansas from our cold, dead hands."
cocrisis.37.t:0 "Kansas Meets with Texas"
cocrisis.37.d:0 "With the recent decision of Oklahoma, Texas has decided to try and secure Kansas as an ally in this crisis. [COC_kansas_talks_with_texas_sl]"
cocrisis.37.a:0 "We have nothing to offer them, unfortunately."
cocrisis.37.b:0 "Oklahoma's decision may have been beneficial after all."
cocrisis.38.t:0 "Kansan Negotiator Arrives"
cocrisis.38.d:0 "The Kansan government, seeing what Texas plans, has sent us a diplomat to negotiate their position in this crisis. It seems that neutrality is no option for Kansas at this current moment. The diplomat has come to see if we can offer something greater than Texas, no doubt referring to the recent developments involving Oklahoma. If we are to offer a Kansan puppet government in Oklahoma City, it's likely that they would agree, seeing as they get to keep their land as well as gain a significant amount of power projection in the region. It would be foolish to allow Oklahoma to get out of this free of consequence for their actions."
cocrisis.38.a:0 "We will make them the offer."
cocrisis.38.b:0 "These demands are outrageous."
cocrisis.39.t:0 "The Coloradan Offer"
cocrisis.39.d:0 "Fearing our collaboration with Texas, the Coloradan govenrment has responded to our trade talks with an offer of their own. In return for our support, they are offering us a puppet government in Oklahoma City after the war. On top of this, they guarantee that we will keep our current borders should we accept the agreement. Objectively, their trade deal is better seeing as we keep our current borders, but we have to take into account the strength disparity of both sides."
cocrisis.39.a:0 "How could we say no?"
cocrisis.39.b:0 "Texas had the better deal."
cocrisis.40.t:0 "Kansas Seeks Negotiations with Colorado"
cocrisis.40.d:0 "In light of our recent attempts to sway Kansas to our side in the crisis, Coloradan diplomats have begun attempting to bring Kansas to their side. We don't know what offer has been made to Kansas at this point, but there isn't much that we can do besides wait and hope that our deal is better received. The Coloradans do not have a leg to stand on, though, so these talks shouldn't amount to much. Only time will tell."
cocrisis.40.a:0 "It will not avail them."
cocrisis.41.t:0 "Kansas Accepts Our Offer"
cocrisis.41.d:0 "It seems that the Coloradans have failed to sway Kansas towards their side in this crisis. The Kansan government has announced earlier today that they will be putting their full diplomatic and military support behind us. With another front opened on Colorado's east, it seems unlikely that they will be able to hold out in this war for very long. The cards continue to fall in our favor, soon victory will be ours and we will waive a triumphant flag over Denver."
cocrisis.41.a:0 "Together, we will win."
cocrisis.42.t:0 "Kansas has Joined Texas"
cocrisis.42.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to sway Kansas, it seems that they have decided to join arms with Texas. The government announced earlier today that they will be throwing their full diplomatic and militaristic might behind the Texan cause. We do not know yet what deal has been made to have Kansas make such a definitive statement against us, but it can't be good for us. This opening of another front will be disasterous for the war effort, especially because of the vast openness of the plains. We will fight until the last man falls."
cocrisis.42.a:0 "We have no choice but to continue fighting."
cocrisis.43.t:0 "Colorado Refuses to Negotiate"
cocrisis.43.d:0 "Despite our efforts to negotiate a fair deal with Colorado, their government has turned us away. It's unknown why they did this as they seem to be outmatched and outnumbered in this conflict, but there are no open channels of diplomacy to question their decision. It was not a wise move to outright decline our offer for negotiation as they are in no position at the moment to be turning away allies but we must move on either way. We only have one option now, and that's to support the Texan government in their efforts."
cocrisis.43.a:0 "A foolish decision."
cocrisis.44.t:0 "Kansas Accepts our Offer"
cocrisis.44.d:0 "Today it seems that actions against us have been beneficial! The movement against us by the Oklahoman government has led to a trade agreement with Kansas, the stronger of the two nations. We have agreed to give them full control of Oklahoma after the war in return for their full diplomatic and military support. Today was a great victory and there will be many more to follow as our nations join arms in the fight against tyranny."
cocrisis.44.a:0 "A cause for celebration!"
cocrisis.45.t:0 "Kansas Moves with Colorado"
cocrisis.45.d:0 "In a disgraceful and disrespectful move today, the Kansan government has announced their full support for Colorado in this crisis. It's still unknown what kind of deal has been made between the two but the Kansan people have decided that Colorado had the better option for them. This will, however, prove to be false as we march into Topeka and overthrow the ruling government there. Today, the Kansan people have made a grave mistake."
cocrisis.45.a:0 "They will learn soon enough."
cocrisis.46.t:0 "Call to Arms!"
cocrisis.46.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to end the crisis diplomatically, war has broken out. Due to our stated position, we are obligated to join our allies in this battle for control of the region. We will band together and emerge victorious over our enemies!"
cocrisis.46.a:0 "Dear god, what have we done?"
cocrisis.47.t:0 "Call to Arms!"
cocrisis.47.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to end the crisis diplomatically, war has broken out. Due to our stated position, we are obligated to join our allies in this battle for control of the region. We will band together and emerge victorious over our enemies!"
cocrisis.47.a:0 "Dear god, what have we done?"
cocrisis.48.t:0 "Our Failure in Colorado"
cocrisis.48.d:0 "Troubling news from the front today. With the war's one year anniversary on the horizon, we have yet to make considerable gains in our goals for Colorado. The Texan populace is growing restless as they watch their cities empty while their sons, husbands, and brothers are being sent off to fight a war that we aren't winning. If we don't come up with some way to change the course of the war into our favor, we may be doomed. We need military changes and we need them quickly."
cocrisis.48.a:0 "Texas is in dire straits."
cocrisis.48.b:0 "We must redirect our focus."
cocrisis.49.t:0 "War Effort Reinvigorated"
cocrisis.49.d:0 "Despite our failures in the first year of the war, it seems that we have begun to get stable footing. We have recently taken Pueblo and Trinidad in southern Colorado as per our first objectives in the war. It's not the swift victory that we hoped but the war might be turning in our favor. We're not in the clear yet but this one victory has already brought much needed confidence to the Texan people and the military."
cocrisis.49.a:0 "A much needed victory."
cocrisis.50.t:0 "Surrender to Colorado?"
cocrisis.50.d:0 "After two thirds of a year, the people of Utah have begun to question the necessity of our war effort. As brothers, husbands, and sons get sent off to our eastern frontier, the people are left wondering why. The justification that we've used in the past doesn't work anymore. Our failure to capture the cities of Grand Junction and Montrose have only soured the public's opinion of both the military and the government. We have to make a choice and soon."
cocrisis.50.a:0 "Our only option is surrender."
cocrisis.50.b:0 "Silence the dissenters and increase conscription."
cocrisis.51.t:0 "Peace with Colorado?"
cocrisis.51.d:0 "Our swift victory in the western theater of this war has left us in an advantageous position against Colorado. With this position, we could pressure their government for peace involving the transfer of [882.GetName]. This would, of course, drastically damage our relations with [TXT.GetName] but it may be worth it to spare the extra lives that could be lost and the public outcry that would insue. Should we decide not to end the war, there would likely be a large drop in support for this war. The choice is simple."
cocrisis.51.a:0 "Offer peace terms to Colorado."
cocrisis.51.b:0 "We will not betray our allies."
cocrisis.52.t:0 "The Surrender of Utah"
cocrisis.52.d:0 "An impressive development on the western front today as diplomats from Utah have requested a ceasefire and terms for peace. It seems that our refusal to give up Grand Junction has caused the Utahan populace to pressure their government to surrender a war that they were no longer fond of. Our terms of peace are the return of borders to pre-war positions as well as war reparations that will help us fund the remainder of this war. The peace is fair and with honor; the Utahan government cannot refuse."
cocrisis.52.a:0 "Send the demands."
cocrisis.52.b:0 "We don't stop until Salt Lake City"
cocrisis.53.t:0 "Coloradan Peace Terms"
cocrisis.53.d:0 "Our delegates have returned with something far too long forgotten; peace. While the war was humiliating and we did not achieve our objectives, we have finally managed to escape it. It seems that the war achieved nothing but the diplomatic isolation of Utah and a strain on the economy, but at least it is over now. All we can do from this point forward is hope for peace amongst our populace and to rebuild and regrow from this humiliating defeat."
cocrisis.53.a:0 "A grave miscalculation on our part..."
cocrisis.54.t:0 "Utahan Peace Terms"
cocrisis.54.d:0 "Because of their victory in the Western theater of the war, the Utahan government has approached us with their peace demands. This was to be expected, of course, because their involvement in the war was purely of opportunism. If we choose to accept their peace, we'd be giving up [882.GetName]. While it's a valuable state to the Coloradan economy, it would be beneficial to free up the forces on the western front. We have to weigh our options carefully."
cocrisis.54.a:0 "These terms are acceptable."
cocrisis.54.b:0 "We will not surrender to opportunists!"
cocrisis.55.t:0 "Peace with Colorado"
cocrisis.55.d:0 "Our peace delegation has returned with good news. The Coloradan government is willing to cede control of [882.GetName] in return for peace. Our decision to seek peace has no doubt harmed relations with our former allies, but we simply were in the war out of opportunity. We will use the newly controlled resources to bolster the Utahan economy even more. Utah has secured its future."
cocrisis.55.a:0 "A cause for celebration!"
cocrisis.56.t:0 "Colorado Refuses Peace"

Our position is still beneficial and we should press our advantage in these early days after the failed peace talks to break their morale even further. Colorado has made a grave mistake that will haunt its future."

cocrisis.57.d:0 "In a disgusting move, Colorado has declined our pleas for peace. It's unknown as to why they have refused our call for peace, but it's certain that there is no need for more blood to be spilled. We can only hope that the Coloradan demands are not too harsh and that we can still achieve peace with honor. The days ahead are grim and the Utahan people will not be happy about the predicament that this establishment has forced upon them."

Many believe that a ceasefire makes the whole war pointless, some even going as far to say that defeat would've been preferable to pointless death. The citizens are becoming more unruly as these debates become more fierce. Only one thing is for certain, though. Everyone is relieved that their loved ones will no longer be sent off to the frontlines to fight. While this turmoil happens today, tomorrow will bring much more happiness and unity among our citizens as their families are whole again. Those lost will be remembered and honored.

Workers and soldiers in even greater numbers than before have decided to leave their duties unfulfilled, bringing our war economy and army to a halt."
