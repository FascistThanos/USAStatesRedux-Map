 newengland.22.t:0 "A Meeting In [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 newengland.22.d:0 "In a small building in downtown [Root.Capital.GetName], members of the [Root.GetNameDef] communist party gathered to discuss a unique opportunity. Word came of a weakened government, of a nation ready to split apart because of a single event: The Great Collapse. All across the former United States new nations would depose of their governers, and push for something better. These members knew this, and wanted to act. With the central government in chaos, the possibility for a communist takeover is possible, to some even certain. But others push back, saying that the people wouldn't support such a coup.\n\nWhat should the Communist Party do?"
 newengland.22.a:0 "Take the first move; If there is a major chance for us to take control do it."
 newengland.22.b:0 "No need to be hasty."

 newengland.23.t:0 "Military Support"
 newengland.23.d:0 "The Military is willing to support our cause, but we must be willing to concide much for this. What will we concide?"
 newengland.23.a:0 "Payoffs to the Army will suffice"
 newengland.23.b:0 "Military Developement can be set aside for the time being"

 newengland.24.t:0 "The People's Support"
 newengland.24.d:0 "The People may be willing to support us if we give them something to support, but this move will cost us. What shall we do?"
 newengland.24.a:0 "Support the common worker"
 newengland.24.b:0 "Political Support shall suffice"

 newengland_news.1.t:0 "Communists Coup [From.Owner.GetName]!"
 newengland_news.1.d:0 "A Shocking Turn of Events, just earlier today members of the [From.Owner.GetName] Communist Party stormed the Government and assumed direct control of the new nation. With the current government already in shambles, there was little resistance to these insurgents, who sweeped over what little defense there was easily.\n\nThe Question now, how will this sudden shift in governance reflect on the people? Popular support for the communists in [Root.GetNameDef] is low, and it will only seem that support will only drop unless the new government can get the ball moving.\n\nNo matter the case, this is yet another case of a turbulent change in an already turbulent region."
 newengland_news.1.a:0 "Interesting"
 newengland_news.1.b:0 "Ok, now what?"
 
 newengland_news.2.t:0 "The New England Initiative has begun!"
 newengland_news.2.d:0 "Today, in front of thousands of cheering supporters, [From.Owner.GetLeader] announced a new idea: New England. A fictional nation, previously described as just a mere region where these "New England" states were. But with the Union dissolved, this formerly radical idea has become mainstream, with people all across the land calling for one thing: the Reunification of New England.\n\nThe leaders of these new nations heard, but were hesitant to act due to the chaos of the Great Collapse. But with this announcement, there is no doubt that others will follow, and the reunification of New England is upon us."
 newengland_news.2.a:0 "A region, soon to be reunited"
