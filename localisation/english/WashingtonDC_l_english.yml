##Focuses
#Opening Tree
DC_constitution:0 "The Second Constitutional Convention"
DC_constitution_desc:0 "The nation is in flames, broken to pieces. What used to unify us have now driven us apart, and now we have come to doubt the abilities of the founding fathers. We need to take a second look at our constitution, which clearly did not adequately protect us from this dissolution. Let us call a second constitutional convention to discuss these matters."
DC_divided:0 "A Nation Divided"
DC_divided_desc:0 "We've decided our constitution, now we need to sort out our political discourse. We are slowly tearing ourselves apart from the inside, and the sooner we sort out these issues the better."
DC_democratic1:0 "Stay the Course"
DC_democratic1_desc:0 "The United States was a Democratic Federal Republic, it is one, and it will be one again in the end. We must keep in mind our history and ideals as we continue onwards on the same path."
DC_democratic2:0 "Reorganize the Government"
DC_democratic2_desc:0 "With the striking of catastrophe which has occured, it has become clear that our government needs to be renovated, so to say. As such, we shall begin work on reorganizing the government to be able to serve the people to the furthest extent it can."
DC_democratic3:0 "Reconvene the House"
DC_democratic3_desc:0 "It’s time for the legislative branch of the government to pick the torch back up, and as such the House of Representatives shall reconvene and carry out its duties as usual."
DC_democratic4:0 "The Court is in Session"
DC_democratic4_desc:0 "All rise for the Supreme Court of the United States, ready to resume its duty as the main body of the judicial branch of our federal government. The Justices are ready once more to hold true to their oaths of office."
DC_democratic5:0 "Reconvene the Senate"
DC_democratic5_desc:0 "It’s time for the legislative branch of the government to pick the torch back up, and as such the Senate shall reconvene and discharge its duties as usual."
DC_democratic6:0 "The State of the Union"
DC_democratic6_desc:0 "WIP"
DC_democratic7:0 "A Brand New Deal"
DC_democratic7_desc:0 "During the State of the Union, President Roosevelt promised economic prosperity to those who would return to the union. To fulfill this promise, we must make our nation an economic power."
DC_democratic8:0 "WPA"
DC_democratic8_desc:0 "Before the collapse, President Roosevelt dreamed of a Worker's Progress Administration that would oversee the nation's recovery from the Great Depression. Let us make it a reality and establish a Federal WPA."
DC_democratic9:0 "Social Security Act"
DC_democratic9_desc:0 "A prosperous society never neglects those in need. We need to protect those among us who are of old age, victims of industrial accidents, the handicapped, and the poor. Our society will be a just one, and it starts with the Social Security Act."
DC_democratic10:0 "Revive the MIC"
DC_democratic10_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex is the lifeblood of our armed forces, and as such it should be treated with the utmost importance. There are threats all around us, and it would seem that our first line of defense is the abilities of the Military Industrial Complex. Therefore, let us fund its expansion!"
DC_democratic11:0 "Job Creation"
DC_democratic11_desc:0 "Washington D.C. is a large city, but a city nonetheless. We cannot hope to compete in manpower with the likes of New York or California. Our only hope is to draw in immigrants from all over the country. We can certainly do that through the creation of jobs, as there will be millions of former federal employees looking for new work."
DC_democratic12:0 "D.C. Public Works"
DC_democratic12_desc:0 "The National Mall is already a well-developed region, but our transit around the city has been hindered by now-blocked roads leading into Virginia and Maryland. We have the opportunity to revitalize our infrastrucure, even create a national metro under the city. This would certainly lead to economic prosperity."
DC_democratic13:0 "One Step Ahead"
DC_democratic13_desc:0 "Though the MIC is certainly a strength, if we don't begin fortifying the national mall, our nation's most important monuments may be lost to marauding forces from our surrounding states. Therefore, a federal program for defense contracting has been proposed, which would help us rapidly develop our defenses around the Capitol."
DC_democratic14:0 "Back In Action"
DC_democratic14_desc:0 "After many months, our efforts have finally paid off. The New Deal will be an amazing success that will lead not only Washington D.C., but every state under our control, to prosperity. Let us congratulate ourselves and look to the future, where we will finally decide our true destiny."
DC_democratic15:0 "Approach Maryland"
DC_democratic15_desc:0 "It is time for us to approach Maryland. We are going to gamble on their support, where they will either accept and join us, or refuse and be invaded."
DC_democratic16:0 "Gunboat Diplomacy"
DC_democratic16_desc:0 "Now that we have a foothold in Maryland, it's time for us to think about our foreign policy. Let us turn to an aggressive approach, where all nations will kneel before us. Let the states fear the approach of their federal government!"
DC_democratic17:0 "Occupy Delaware"
DC_democratic17_desc:0 "Delaware might be small, but they are traitors nonetheless. We must welcome them back into the fold through force. It should be fairly easy to conquer such a small nation, especially after the integration of Maryland."
DC_democratic18:0 "David vs. Goliath"
DC_democratic18_desc:0 "Virginia will undoubtedly be one of the most difficult nations to conquer. They possess a significant army and industry, and our war will be nothing short of intense. Nevertheless, we must march onwards to capture Richmond, for the spoils of war will be even greater than we can imagine!"
DC_democratic19:0 "The Pennsylvania Matter"
DC_democratic19_desc:0 "Pennsylvania lies to our north, and they remain a thorn in our side. Their industry is great, and their resources even greater, which is why they must be reintegrated. We cannot allow such a powerhouse to remain on our borders. If we fail to strike first, then they will surely do so before us!"
DC_democratic20:0 "Seize West Virginia"
DC_democratic20_desc:0 "The Mountains of West Virginia, though treacherous, hide large deposits of oil. The capture of these fields would fuel our nation for years to come, and if we are to grow our armed forces, then West Virginia must be reintegrated."
DC_democratic21:0 "Subdue New Jersey"
DC_democratic21_desc:0 "After our capture of Pennsylvania, our eyes turned to New Jersey. Their industrial capacity grows by the day, and while it might be less than ours, their factories would make a fine addition to the republic."
DC_democratic22:0 "March South"
DC_democratic22:0 "The Carolinas are our next logical step after the reintegration of Virginia. Let us march along the coast until they are brought to heel!"
DC_fascist1:0 "Battle of Pennsylvania Avenue"
DC_fascist1_desc:0 "We have on standby several members of the American Legion and rogue elements of the Army. We have the opportunity to strike at the heart of the Republic, and root out that bastard Roosevelt. Should we be successful, we will celebrate the Battle of Pennsylvania Avenue for years to come!"
DC_fascist2:0 "Habeas Corpus Suspension"
DC_fascist2_desc:0 "The writ of Habeas Corpus mandates that every person must be given a trial. Given the state of our justice system, this is something that will take far too long. It would be easier for our armed forces to decide who's guilty. Let's suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus, and begin rounding up traitors!"
DC_fascist4:0 "Appoint Hoover"
DC_fascist4_desc:0 "There is no intelligence officer quite like J. Edgar Hoover. A veteran of the FBI, this man would make a fine Director of the FBI. With his help, we can modernize our intelligence network to better suit our nation's needs."
DC_fascist5:0 "COINTELPRO"
DC_fascist5_desc:0 "The Counter Intelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, is a program designed to root out political opponents and prevent them from gaining traction. After our recent victories, this is especially important, as we cannot allow dissenters to operate on our soil. Let's approve the program and get to work!"
DC_fascist6:0 "Recruit McCarthy"
DC_fascist6_desc:0 "Joseph McCarthy, former Senator from Montana, is an interesting man. A virulent anti-communist, he has been staunchly against the actions of the President, accusing him of being a closeted communist. This man is rabid for his country, and is always willing to hunt down any trace of communism. This man puts the scare in Red Scare, and we need him to get to work!"
DC_fascist7:0 "Round Up Communists"
DC_fascist7_desc:0 "McCarthy's efforts have been successful, and we've managed to round up what we believe to be the remnants of communism in the Capitol region. We'll put them through a show trial and give them a swift execution, but they cannot be allowed to spread their harmful ideology."
DC_fascist8:0 "Rally the Legion"
DC_fascist8_desc:0 "The time has finally come for us to rise from the ashes of instability. We will be holding a press conference on the steps of the Capitol, where we will announce the new leader of the United States. Thousands of people will show up to support us on this glorious day, which is surely a sign that our political woes are over!"
DC_fascist9:0 "Caesar Marches Home"
DC_fascist9_desc:0 "Douglas MacArthur is a legend amongst our army. This is a man who looks war in the face and spits on it. Some of the men have started to call him the American Caesar, as they think that he could be the one to reclaim the former United States. Should we contact him to lead the nation to victory?global."
DC_fascist10:0 "For God and Country!"
DC_fascist10_desc:0 "Alvin Owsley, leader of the American Legion, is certainly a viable candidate for President. He was integral in the plot to overthrow Roosevelt, and we are certainly in his debt. Owsley has recently been openly critical of our Armed Forces, arguing that there are underpaid, underequipped, and undervalued. He promises to revitalize the military and give our soldiers the treatment they deserve."
DCD_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Arms!"
DCD_call_to_arms_desc:0 "Our situation is dire, but we must not forget our place in the world, the American Experiment is for the people, of the people, and by the people. We will keep this in mind as well as remind the others of it as we progress through these turbulent times."

#Democratic Tree
DCD_liberty_prevails:0 "Liberty Prevails!"
DCD_liberty_prevails_desc:0 "So long as Washington D.C. remains dedicated to freedom and liberty, it shall shine as a beacon in the world. However, first, that beacon must illuminate her immediate neighbors and bring back hope and faith in democracy to their populations. We will stand once more for Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness."
DCD_Famed13:0 "The Famed 13"
DCD_Famed13_desc:0 "The American Experiment, Dream, and Republic all began with the Thirteen. As such, the American Recovery will do so as well. The time has come for Capitol Hill to shine upon them and their constituents, and so the District of Columbia will reach out to them each."
DCD_mediate:0 "Mediate Interstate Conflicts"
DCD_mediate_desc:0 "The United States prior to its collapse had several conflicts between the states when it came to boundaries and borders. Without an inhibitor, they will now likely spark into full blown wars. That is where we will step in, just as we have in the past. Washington as the negotiator, these petty squabbles between brothers and sisters of the American people will be laid to rest."
DCD_diplomatic_war:0 "Declare a Diplomatic War"
DCD_diplomatic_war_desc:0 "The District of Columbia under the Roosevelt Administration has already declared that it will not stand for undemocratic practices on this continent, and now she intends to stand by her word. President Roosevelt shall do all in his power to prevent communist and fascist agitators and extremists from stripping away the hard fought rights of any American in their new found domains."
DCD_our_ideals:0 "Common Liberalism"
DCD_our_ideals_desc:0 "Columbia hasn’t lost its diplomatic edge after all, and so now with our excellent connection to the state governments, we can further brighten that beautiful glow of the torch of liberty. We will inspire in our friends an old sense of liberalism, republicanism, and democracy which may have been lost in the recent turbulence."
DCD_third_congress:0 "Call for the Third Continental Congress"
DCD_third_congress_desc:0 "The First and Second Continental Congresses saw the colonies come together to unite as states of a single republic. Well, it is time again for the states to reunite into that republic, stronger and bolder and wiser, with little under two hundred years of experience to guide it once more. We look to our past to look into our future as we call for delegates to meet and confer, for the betterment of America."

#Successful CC
DCD_successful_congress:0 "The Continental Congress was a Success!"
DCD_successful_congress_desc:0 "The delegates have spoken, and the disastrous collapse of the United States will be undone. The road to reunification will be a long and tedious one but one with a wonderfully lit path into the future in the end."
DCD_radio_liberty:0 "Radio Liberty Campaign"
DCD_radio_liberty_desc:0 "Now that we’re set upon our path to reunification and rebuilding, it has been decided by the highest levels of the government that radio is the way to reach out to the people. Just as President Roosevelt boosted the morale of America a few years ago with his fireside chats, Radio Liberty will do the same, with perhaps even a few messages from our dear leader."
DCD_radio_liberty_middle:0 "Expand to the Middle Colonies"
DCD_radio_liberty_middle_desc:0 "Radio Liberty has been successful thus far, but it's time to broaden our reach to the Mid-Atlantic, where the economic capital of NYC sits, sterling in her silver walls. So too do the industrial might of Pittsburg and the vast coast of New Jersey rest in the region."
DCD_radio_liberty_north:0 "Expand to the North"
DCD_radio_liberty_north_desc:0 "The North is a cemented part of the United States and is thus a cemented path of expansion for Radio Liberty. Being the most populous part of the country, truly reaching out to the people of this region is essential for the survival of the Union."
DCD_radio_liberty_south:0 "Infiltrate the South"
DCD_radio_liberty_south_desc:0 "Radio Liberty must expand so as to further our reach to the American People. The South will be a primary path for us to take, as it is a historical core part of the United States, despite any past turbulence during the 1770s or 1860s."
DCD_push_southwest:0 "Push to the SouthWest"
DCD_push_southwest_desc:0 "Although far from Washington, the Southwest is an essential part of the US, and so it is an essential path of expansion for Radio Liberty, so that we might renew the morale and faith in Democracy of the folks living there."
DCD_radio_liberty_west:0 "Reclaim Manifest Destiny"
DCD_radio_liberty_west_desc:0 "Manifest Destiny was the American belief that we had the God given right to expand our power, influence, and borders from sea to shining sea, and so we did. Now however, it’s time that we apply that logic to Radio Liberty so that we once and for all can expand our reach to every single American citizen who has been affected by the collapse and bring them hope once more through the power of the broadcast."

#Failed CC
DCD_congress_failure:0 "The Continental Congress was a Failure!"
DCD_congress_failure_desc:0 "The delegates have spoken, and it seems that reunification will not be as easy as previously hoped. This is not the end, however, as there are less than ideal methods, ones in which the results outweigh the means of getting there."
DCD_renounce_occupation:0 "An End to our Residency"
DCD_renounce_occupation_desc:0 "Washington D.C. occupies leased land from Maryland and Virginia, and with the recent fallout behind the failure of the Third Continental Congress, it has been decided that this land should be returned."
DCD_unify_the_fronts:0 "Unify the Fronts"
DCD_unify_the_fronts_desc:0 "With peaceful reunification attempted and ending in failure, it’s time for a different approach. The military shall step in and dispel the turmoil of the political sphere in our nation"
DCD_support_foreign_democratic:0 "Support Foreign Democratic Causes"
DCD_support_foreign_democratic_desc:0 "The United States is not the sole democratic nation in this world which is experiencing troubles. Mexico and Canada too have fractured and the Caribbean has been let loose to be corrupted with extremist ideals. As such, we shall afford some of our attention abroad and support those who value the rights of their people just as we do."
DCD_beacon_democracy:0 "Beacon of Democracy"
DCD_beacon_democracy_desc:0 "America stands as an example, one of democracy and one for governments across the globe. When people think of democracy, the United States of America is their first thought, and so, we will climb back upon that mantle and once again stand before the world as the Beacon of Democracy, lighting the way."
DCD_desegregate:0 "American Full Desegregation Act"
DCD_desegregate_desc:0 "America is a land for the people and guarantees its citizens equal rights under God… on paper. The reality is less fair, until now. The Full Desegregation Act truly guarantees the freedoms afforded by the law to all Americans."
DCD_womens_rights:0 "Women's Armed Service Integration Act"
DCD_womens_rights_desc:0 "With American desegregation in full swing, there’s just one more group of citizens who lack the same guarantee of rights as the rest, women. Women are granted suffrage under the constitution, yet they’re not allowed to serve their nation in the same way as men are. This incredibly sexist restriction has left many disappointed and upset with the government, and so we must correct our previous wrongs."
DCD_defensive_armaments:0 "Prepare for Defeat"
DCD_defensive_armaments_desc:0 "While military defeats are not ideal, they do happen. We must be ready for the worst, and so to defend our small district we shall begin to construct defensive infrastructure, primarily fortifications."
DCD_cult_of_washington:0 "Open the Washington Military Academy"
DCD_cult_of_washington_desc:0 "Due to the fact that the United States Military Academy at West Point is not exactly under our control at the moment, we find ourselves in a peculiar situation as we haven’t an academy dedicated to the officer corps of our army. As such, to rectify the situation, a new academy will be established and opened within the District of Columbia, its namesake the same as ours."
DCD_operation_phoenix:0 "Operation Phoenix"
DCD_operation_phoenix_desc:0 "A phoenix rises from its ashes in death in a blaze of glory. Under Operation Phoenix, we shall begin a path which shall ensure that the United States does the same. In the end, the results will justify the means, such is a guarantee."
DCD_federation_once_more:0 "A Federation Once More"
DCD_federation_once_more_desc:0 "Following the success of Operation Phoenix, instead of maintaining a permanent garrison in Maryland which will be extremely taxing on our resources, we have the ability to reestablish our federation of states. E Pluribus Unum. "
DCD_reclaim_states:0 "Bring States Back Into the Fold"
DCD_reclaim_states_desc:0 "With the foundations of our federation relayed, the time has finally come for us to truly reunite the nation. Let us bring the states back into the fold and reverse this crisis."

dc_news.0.t:0 "The Federal Government Makes a Statement"
dc_news.0.d:0 "To the American and Canadian and Mexican people who’ve seen their homes and beacons of freedom, liberty, and democracy shattered, let this news give you hope once more: The American Capital of the Washington District of Columbia has not yielded and will not yield. Dark and reactionary forces of the extremes shall not touch these streets nor these walls. This collapse of our system is but a small inconvenience, one which we will overcome, and that is why today with this announcement, Washington D.C. renews its commitment to Democracy and the Republic, and why she also announces that she refuses to see the people’s freedoms decay on this continent. Suffrage is the right of the people; we must uphold our values in spite of turbulence. Remember all that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance”."
