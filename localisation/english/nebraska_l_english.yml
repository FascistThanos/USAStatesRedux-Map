    nnebraska.2.t:0 "Operation: Headstrong"
    nnebraska.2.d:0 "Orders from above are to seize the western lands from South Dakota. It is part of their goal to re-establish the Nebraskan Territory, and this is a major stepping stone to be able to eventually reach our rightful Montanan lands. We just have to hope that the kinship between the Dakotas isn't too strong."
    nnebraska.2.a:0 "It'll be over before they know it."
    nnebraska.3.t:0 "Hostility In The South"
    nnebraska.3.d:0 "Our intelligence tells us that Nebraska is making military preparations towards our Southern sister. This is extremely alarming as if South Dakota falls, we are a likely target for their next military campaign. It may be a wise idea to stand with South Dakota if it comes to war, as the two of us may be able to push the Nebraskans back."
    nnebraska.3.a:0 "Anything to protect our home."

They are seeming to be setting up a somewhat formidable fighting force, so caution is advised. This victory will prove to be a major morale boost however. Once we have what we've been told to take, we are to leave them be."
    nnebraska.4.a:0 "They won't stand a chance"
    nnebraska.5.t:0 "Operation: Buffalo Soldier"
    nnebraska.5.d:0 "Washington has orders for us. We are to seize the lands of the former Nebraska Territory from Wyoming. This will be much of the state, and we are to either establish a friendly government in the rest, or leave it to the traitorous dogs to fight over. Claiming Cheyenne will increase the legitimacy of our cause to the people, and hopefully lead to restoring order on the continent."
    nnebraska.5.a:0 "One step closer to destiny"
    nnebraska.6.t:0 "Operation: Sioux"
    nnebraska.6.d:0 "With South Dakota taken care of, Washington has ordered us to continue our course along the Missouri and seize their western lands.

    nnebraska.6.a:0 "To arms, soldiers!"
    nnebraska.7.t:0 "Operation: Cumulus"
    nnebraska.7.d:0 "With a path now clear into Montana, D.C. has given us the orders to march onto Helena, and seize the majority of their lands. They seem to have plans for the westernmost parts, so we have been ordered to only take the locations defined by our orders."
