 newyork.1.t:0 "Aftermath Of The 1936 Election"
 newyork.1.d:0 "While the great dissolution of the United States has caused much strife and instability in all of the states, it seems that the people of New York have chosen to remain a strong democracy. On Long Island however, Earl Browder and the Communist Party USA have taken up arms against the government, with the rallying cry of a rigged election. They claim officials overseeing the ballots have tampered with the results for years. Word is that the party has been coercing workers to rise up against the state. It seems bloodshed is the only way to stop it at this point."
 newyork.1.a:0 "Workers of North America will be liberated, down with corrupt elections!"
 newyork.1.b:0 "The Empire state will not turn red!"
 newyork.2.t:0 "The Captain's Talks"
 newyork.2.d:0 "When the United States collapsed, many officers within the United States Navy came back to New York to work with some of the largest drydocks on the East Coast, as well as to establish a strong naval presence in New York. With the Communist Party gaining so much traction in New York City, many of these officers have come to the government offering solutions to quell their uprisings. Many of these solutions seem extreme however, and if the Navy gains too much of a foothold, we may just lose power to them. We're walking a very dangerous tightrope now."

 newyork.3.t:0 "New York Invites Us To The Federation"

 newyork.31.t:0 "New Jersey Scorns Our Offer"

 newyork.13.d:0 "The order is being given, we are to take Cuba and secure it for the military. Our island hopping has been leading up to this one."
 newyork.13.a:0 "Cuba will be ours."
 newyork.14.t:0 "Operation: Safe Passage"
 newyork.14.d:0 "With the annexation of Cuba complete, Washington sees only one more necessity for Atlantic domination. The Panama Canal."

 cnewyork.1.t:0 "New York's Demands"
 cnewyork.1.d:0 "Envoys from New York arrived today with a very clear message, that we must begin our annexation into their state effective immediately. They have amassed a large number of divisions at our door and seem prepared to use military force if they must. Discussions have begun in favor of this annexation; but perhaps if we found a common ally in Pennsylvania, we might be able to thwart them, or better yet, avoid a war altogether."
 cnewyork.1.a:0 "Accept New York's demands"
 cnewyork.1.b:0 "Reach out to Pennsylvania for aid."
 cnewyork.2.t:0 "New Jersey's Plea"
 cnewyork.2.d:0 "We received a letter from Newark today explaining an escalation between New Jersey and New York. It seems that New York is looking to expand their territory and New Jersey seems to be the victim in that. They are requesting a guarantee of independence for them from us to dissuade New York ambitions or if it comes to it, tackling them together. This could be an incredible opportunity to challenge their presence in the region, and many members of the war cabinet seem to be on board."
 cnewyork.2.a:0 "Guarantee New Jersey."
 cnewyork.2.b:0 "Dismiss this letter."
 cnewyork.3.t:0 "Philadelphia Accepts!"
 cnewyork.3.d:0 "It seems that our call for aid has been answered! Hopefully with this, New York backs down and we can avoid a conflict altogether. Now if it comes down to it, we at the very least have a very strong backing."
 cnewyork.3.a:0 "Let's see if they stand down..."
 cnewyork.4.t:0 "Pennsylvanian Interference"
 cnewyork.4.d:0 "It seems that in a desperate ploy to ensure that the workers of New Jersey stay oppressed, they have decided to form a sort of coalition with Pennsylvania. While this does complicate the matter, many members of our war cabinet is seeing this as a good chance to kill two birds with one stone. We just have to be sure that we can actually take this fight, we don't want all our efforts to be for nothing."
 cnewyork.4.a:0 "We'll do what we can to liberate the people."
 cnewyork.5.t:0 "Pennsylvania Ignores Our Pleas"
 cnewyork.5.d:0 "It seems that we have been left alone to weather this storm. The armies of Pennsylvania will not protect us from the forces of New York, they are only dooming themselves. Much of our government is preparing to accept the New York demands, but maybe, just maybe we can stand a chance."
 cnewyork.5.a:0 "Accept New York's demands."
 cnewyork.5.b:0 "Reject their demands."
 cnewyork.6.t:0 "New Jersey Remains Defiant"
 cnewyork.6.d:0 "It seems that the government of New Jersey believes that they can stop the revolution. The people will be liberated and shown that capitalism only serves to enslave the masses and feed the wealthy. We will show them the way forward."
 cnewyork.6.a:0 "Forward, onto Newark!"
 cnewyork.11.t:0 "A Partner In Ohio"
 cnewyork.11.d:0 "With the revolution sparked in Ohio, it seems only right that we get involved as their official protector. If anyone tries to stop this spark, they will be met with the full force of our army."

 cnewyork.12.t:0 "Refugees"
 cnewyork.12.d:0 "With the communist revolts and fighting across the border, many local leaders from Ohio are proposing they secede into our state officially. Given the collapse of their former government, it seems the choice is up to us."

 cnewyork.12.b:0 "They are on their own on this one."
 cnewyork.13.t:0 "Refugees"

 cnewyork.17.t:0 "Refugees"

 cnewyork.19.t:0 "A Partner In Wisconsin"
 cnewyork.19.d:0 "With the revolution sparked in Wisconsin, it seems only right that we get involved as their official protector. If anyone tries to stop this spark, they will be met with the full force of our army."

 cnewyork.20.b:0 "They are on their own on this one"
 cnewyork.21.t:0 "New York's Coup Attempt"
 cnewyork.21.d:0 "It seems that New York's meddling has reached us. They have given us an ultimatum: peacefully transition our government into one underneath their "protection", or they will do it themselves. We may have a chance fighting it, but many, many lives may be lost in that process."
 cnewyork.21.a:0 "We will fight this scourge!"
 cnewyork.21.b:0 "The lives of our people matter most."
