form_the_aca_desc:0 "Acadia was a colony of New France in northeastern North America which included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and Maine to the Kennebec River. During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia. It was eventually divided into British colonies. The first capital of Acadia was established in 1605 as Port-Royal. A British force from Virginia attacked and burned down the town in 1613, but it was later rebuilt nearby, where it remained the longest-serving capital of French Acadia until the British Siege of Port Royal in 1710. There were six colonial wars in a 74-year period in which British interests tried to capture Acadia, starting with King William's War in 1689. French troops from Quebec, Acadians, the Wabanaki Confederacy, and French priests continually raided New England settlements along the border in Maine during these wars. Acadia was conquered in 1710 during Queen Anne's War, while New Brunswick and much of Maine remained contested territory. Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton remained under French control, as agreed under Article XIII of the Treaty of Utrecht."

The territory included all of the modern U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. In the 1836 Siete Leyes government reorganization, the two Californias were once again combined (as a single departamento). That change was undone in 1846, but rendered moot by the U.S. military occupation of California in the Mexican-American War."

It's unknown how well the new centralized economy will work or if the wealth redistribution will also affect political elites. Below Huey Long are four other individuals. Gerald Smith is a clergyman that leads the 'Share Our Wealth' program. The second is Father Charles Coughlin, a Canadian-American catholic priest from Ontario who hosts a weekly radio program known for it's racist and anti-semitic preachings. Third is WIlliam Dudley Pelley who leads the authoritarian faction and often criticizes Long for being too lenient. Fourth and finally is Charles Lindbergh who represents the less popular democratic and moderate portions of the party."

Since its recognition as a distinctive region in the late 19th century, Appalachia has been a source of enduring myths and distortions regarding the isolation, temperament, and behavior of its inhabitants. Early 20th century writers often engaged in yellow journalism focused on sensationalistic aspects of the region's culture, such as moonshining and clan feuding, and often portrayed the region's inhabitants as uneducated and prone to impulsive acts of violence. While endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with poverty. Appalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a coonskin cap and buckskin clothing, and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped powder horn. Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from "civilization" by high mountain ridges, and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century."

These three city-states ruled that area in and around the Valley of Mexico from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish conquistadores and their native allies who ruled under Hernán Cortés defeated them in 1521. The alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of Azcapotzalco and its former tributary provinces. Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, the capital Tenochtitlan became dominant militarily. By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the alliance were effectively ruled from Tenochtitlan, while other partners of the alliance had taken subsidiary roles. The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual tribute to the alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy."

The federation consists of 3 major states: Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Coming after the major states are the 3 minor states: Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico. The once-independent nations with the least amount of power in the federation are the micro-states of St. Kitts and Nevis, Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago. Although small independently, these nations make up a total area of about 78,380 square miles, which is just larger than Nebraska.

These lands feature diverse terrain, from the foothills in the piedmont, the arable land in the tidewater, to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Mississippi River in the west. These variations in terrain allowed for a diverse economy, boasting large industries in agriculture and textiles. Although the division between the northern and southern governments became complete in 1712, both colonies remained in the hands of the same group of proprietors. A rebellion against the proprietors broke out in 1719 which led to the appointment of a royal governor for South Carolina in 1720. After nearly a decade in which the British government sought to locate and buy out the proprietors, both North and South Carolina became royal colonies in 1729.

The last of the Thirteen Colonies to be established by Great Britain it had the closest ties to the former colonizer of any of the colonies. When violence broke out between the Revolutionaries and the British army, the Georgian colonists were divided on how to act about it. It's establishment was primarily based on a need for a buffer state or 'garrison' state between the colonies and Spanish Florida. Because of it's establishment as a border state to defend against threats, the farmers were expected to be able to take up arms and hold a defense. Due to this, slavery was prohibited in the colony until 1751 when Georgia became a royal colony."

At the time of its creation, the territory included all the land west of Pennsylvania, northwest of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River below the Great Lakes, and what later became known as the Boundary Waters. The region was ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Paris of 1783. Throughout the Revolutionary War, the region was part of the British Province of Quebec. It spanned all or large parts of six eventual U.S. states (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the northeastern part of Minnesota). Reduced to present-day Ohio, eastern Michigan and a sliver of southeastern Indiana with the formation of Indiana Territory July 4, 1800, it ceased to exist March 1, 1803, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Ohio, and the remainder attached to Indiana Territory."

form_the_PSA_desc:0 "During the Second American Civil War, a breakaway state known as the Pacific States of America rose up. Taking place on the West Coast, the Pacific States of America quickly seized control of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. After this, they began to push inwards towards the Central United States. Now with the Federal Government gone, the Pacific States of America can be realized. Consolodation of power on the West Coast would create a power that is able to project itself across the globe with the Pacific Fleet of the former United States. It's geography makes it easily defensable with the ocean in the west, forests in the north, deserts in the south, and desert mountains in the east. To take over this nation would be no easy task and their army makes it no easier. To stomp this nation back off the continent would be a feat that we cannot allow to be achieved. The Pacific States shall be sat on the coast for centuries to come, bringing liberty to all in their reach. The Pacific States of America shall live on and remain united."

form_the_TLH_desc:0 "As designed by Oklahoman A. P. Sights, forty-six counties in Texas and twenty-three in Oklahoma would join to form Texlahoma. The proposal did get some traction. Sights claimed that two-thirds of the politicians he polled favored the idea. The New York Times, although skeptical, covered the plan in significant detail. In addition, the American vice president at the time, John Nance Garner IV, was a big supporter of carving Texas into new states. The main support behind Texlahoma was to increase road infrastructure as the automobile became more and more popular. The poor infrastructure sparked outcry for the states to unite. Sadly, it did not come to fruition, but today we can change that. With the formation of Texlahoma, we can project power and gain more renoun on the North American content. With the strength that comes with the unification of the two states, we may be able to plunge deeper into the continent and realize greater ambitions. If that is to be achieved, our people must be united together first. We must bring those around us to heel as we grow in power."

form_the_FME_desc:0 "Imperio Mexicano was a constitutional monarchy, the first independent government of Mexico and the only former colony of the Spanish Empire to establish a monarchy after independence. It is one of the few modern-era, independent monarchies that have existed in the Americas, along with the Brazilian Empire. It is typically denominated as the First Mexican Empire to distinguish it from the Second Mexican Empire. Agustín de Iturbide, the sole monarch of the empire, was originally a Mexican military commander under whose leadership independence from Spain was gained in September 1821. His popularity culminated in mass demonstrations on 18 May 1822, in favour of making him emperor of the new nation, and the very next day congress hastily approved the matter. A sumptuous coronation ceremony followed in July. The empire was plagued throughout its short existence by questions about its legality, conflicts between congress and the emperor, and a bankrupt treasury. Iturbide dissolved the congress in October 1822, replacing it with a junta of supporters, and by December of that year had begun to lose support of the army, which revolted in favor of restoring congress. After failing to put down the revolt, Iturbide reconvened congress in March 1823, and offered his abdication, upon which power passed to a provisional government which ultimately abolished the monarchy."

form_the_TGC_desc:0 "The Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC) was a secret society founded in 1854 by American George W. L. Bickley, the objective of which was to create a new country, known as the Golden Circle, where slavery would be legal. The country would have been centered in Havana and would have consisted of the Southern United States and a "golden circle" of territories in Mexico (which was to be divided into 25 new slave states), Central America, northern parts of South America, and Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and most other islands in the Caribbean, about 2,400 miles (3,900 km) in diameter. Originally, the KGC advocated that the new territories should be annexed by the United States, in order to vastly increase the number of slave states and thus the power of the slave-holding Southern upper classes. In response to the increased anti-slavery agitation that followed the Dred Scott decision (1857) the Knights changed their position: the Southern United States should secede, forming their own confederation, and then invade and annex the area of the Golden Circle to vastly expand the power of the South. In the United States, the new country's northern border would roughly coincide with the Mason–Dixon line, and within it were included such cities as Washington D.C., St. Louis, Mexico City, and Panama City."

If either of us wish to survive this new era, we must put our grudges aside, albeit temporarily, and defend ourselves as one united front.

With the Depression came the Collapse, with the Collapse, a nation over a century old suddenly exploded into 50 new ones. The USA was the hegemonic state of the New World, especially with the Monroe Doctrine. Now, we’ve finally brought the states back under a single flag. We have work to do, but by God, it is time to start our restoration back to our former status. The disunion was the darkest hour in American history. This, however, will be our very finest hour, and today's date will go down in history as the States become United once again. Though only a fraction of what we once were, we will claim our former lands and reclaim what was once ours. Our nation is now solidified once more, but we still have lots of work to do. The Union's collapse was unfortunate, but we shall not repeat history. We must build a nation out of our own ashes with a stronger government. The United States will rise back to it's former power and grow even further. The fight will be long and hard, but Patriots have never been the type to give up against a stronger enemy."

form_VNS_title:0 "Viceroyalty of New Spain"
form_the_VNS_desc:0 "New Spain, officially the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Virreinato de Nueva España) or Kingdom of New Spain, was an integral territorial entity of the Spanish Empire, established by Habsburg Spain during the Spanish colonization of the Americas and having its capital in Mexico City. Its jurisdiction comprised a huge area that included what are now Mexico, much of the Southwestern U.S. and California in North America, Central America, northern parts of South America, and several territorial Pacific Ocean archipelagos. After the 1521 Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, conqueror Hernán Cortés named the territory New Spain, and established the new capital of Mexico City on the site of the Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. Central Mexico became the base of expeditions of exploration and conquest, expanding the territory claimed by the Spanish Empire. With the political and economic importance of the conquest, the crown asserted direct control over the densely populated realm. The crown established New Spain as a viceroyalty in 1535, appointing as viceroy Antonio de Mendoza, an aristocrat loyal to the monarch rather than the conqueror Cortés. New Spain was the first of the viceroyalties that Spain created, the second being Peru in 1542, following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. Both New Spain and Peru had dense indigenous populations at conquest as a source of labor and material wealth in the form of vast silver deposits, discovered and exploited beginning in the mid 1500s."
