 kansas.2.t:0 "Kansan Victory!"
 kansas.2.d:0 "After intense fighting in Kansas City, the Kansan national guard was victorious! An impromptu victory parade was organized along the Kansas River, with General Eisenhower delivering a short address to the celebrating soldiers. However, our forces remain ready to press the attack, should we decide that it's necessary."
 kansas.2.a:0 "Wonderful, remain vigilant!"
 kansas.2.b:0 "Press the attack, we will march all the way to St. Louis!"
 kansas.3.t:0 "Missourian Victory!"
 kansas.3.d:0 "Earlier today, border conflicts along the Kansas-Missouri border culminated in an all out skirmish between the two states. After intense fighting in Kansas City, the Missouri national guard was victorious! Jubilant soldiers gathered in front of the Power and Light building to organize a small parade, much to the dismay of Kansan spectators."
 kansas.3.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 kansas.4.t:0 "Police Units Join!"

Originally owned by the U.S. government, it was seized by the state of Kansas shortly after the collapse of the United States. However, the plant was rendered mostly inoperable by U.S. government holdouts during the plant's capture. Restoring the plant to working order would increase our military production capacities."
 KSK_infrastructure2:0 "Intrastate Highways"
 KSK_infrastructure2_desc:0 "Originally an idea to create an interstate highway system, the Intrastate Highway Initiative is a measure to further ease our logistical strains. By expanding our highways, we give them military application, as the transport of equipment becomes even easier."

 KSK_democratic2_desc:0 "Realpolitik is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. In these trying times, it is our only hope to survive."
 KSK_democratic3:0 "Kansas City Referendum"
 KSK_democratic3_desc:0 "In the wake of the border skirmish that left hundreds dead, the people of Kansas City deserve to plot their own destiny. We should hold a referendum to see if they would like to stay in their state, or join ours."
 KSK_democratic4:0 "Beacon of Liberty"
 KSK_democratic4_desc:0 "If we are to survive these trying times, we must be a lighthouse among the dark shadows of uncertainty. Signal to others that we are a beacon of democracy, and they will change their ways."

 KSK_democratic6:0 "Accept Refugees"
 KSK_democratic6_desc:0 "Following the dissolution of the United States and the rapid evolution of political parties, many individuals decided to flee their home state in search of something familar.

 KSK_democratic7:0 "Join The Allies"
 KSK_democratic7_desc:0 "Our best chance of survival would be to enter ourselves onto the world stage, joining the Allies in their fight against fascism. Let's send a petition to the Allies, and gain much needed support from foreign allies."

 KSK_democratic11:0 "Continental Soldiarity"
 KSK_democratic11_desc:0 "Our best chance at surviving these trying times is to ally ourselves with like-minded states. Preserving our democracy should be our highest priority, and what better way than defending our fellow democracies?"
 KSK_communist1:0 "Browder's Revolution"
 KSK_communist1_desc:0 "Earl Browder, former leader of the Communist Party USA, has been advocating for a radical regime change in the wake of the collapse."

 KSK_communist:0 "Officers to Commissars"
 KSK_communist_desc:0 "Our officer corps is due for an overhaul, and the first order of business is assuring party loyalty. Within every division there will be an operative of the KCIA, the Kansan Commissariat for Internal Affairs. Modeled after the Soviet NKVD, this will inspire loyalty in our troops- by force."
 KSK_communist4:0 "For the Heartland!"
 KSK_communist4_desc:0 "The time has come for war! We have been suddenly and deliberately attacked by those who would halt our revolution! We must prevent this at all costs! For Browder! For Heartland! For Kansas!"
 KSK_communist5:0 "Begin the Five Year Plan"
 KSK_communist5_desc:0 "Workers of the state, it is time to begin the Five Year Plan! The road will be arduous, but the reward will be great! Let us transform this agrarian expanse into an industrial powerhouse!"
 KSK_communist6:0 "Nationalize Industry"
 KSK_communist6_desc:0 "The factories of the rich belong to the worker! It's time for us to control the means of production, and use them to benefit our great state!"
 KSK_communist7:0 "Soviet Diplomatic Mission"

 KSK_communist8_desc:0 "Finally, we can become a member of the Comintern! Today marks a momentous occasion, where the Socialist Republic of Kansas became an official member of the Communist Internationale."
 KSK_communist9:0 "Our Own Destiny"
 KSK_communist9_desc:0 "The meeting with the Soviets proved one thing- that they are thoroughly committed to socialism in one country.

 KSK_communist10:0 "Finish the Five Year Plan"
 KSK_communist10_desc:0 "We have learned much from the five year plan! Our production capabilites have expanded, and we can now stand on our own as an industrial power. Let us finish the five year plan and finalize our progress!"
 KSK_fascist1:0 "The Jayhawk Nazi"
 KSK_fascist1_desc:0 "Gerald Burton Winrod is an outspoken supporter of Nazi Germany and a strong opponent of communism. He says that the only way to save the world from communism is to turn to fascism. He is virulently anti-semitic, an undesirable trait that will surely alienate him from some of our citizens, but that is a sacrifice we are willing to make to combat communism."
 KSK_fascist2:0 "Integrate Legionaires"
 KSK_fascist2_desc:0 "The American Legion is ripe for recruitment, and integrating these battle hardened veterans would surely increase our fighting ability."
 KSK_fascist3:0 "Militarize the Police"
 KSK_fascist3_desc:0 "We have the opportunity to follow in Germany's footsteps, establishing our own state secret police force. Additionally, allowing them into our ranks would aid our fight against partisans immensely."
 KSK_fascist4:0 "Conscript the Boy Scouts"
 KSK_fascist4_desc:0 "The Boy Scouts of America may seem like an unlikely candidate for conscription, but many of the scouts would prove to be effective reconaissance units in the army."
 KSK_fascist5:0 "Train With The Bund"
 KSK_fascist5_desc:0 "Training with the American Bund elements within our state would allow us to focus our efforts to more important places, and worry less about our training processes. They might even receive a better training from these fanatics."
 KSK_fascist6:0 "War Readiness Initiative"
 KSK_fascist6_desc:0 "In order to mobilize our nation, we must first expand our military readiness. This means pre-emptive rationing, and prioritizing the construction of arms factories."
 KSK_fascist7:0 "Corporate Tax Breaks"
 KSK_fascist7_desc:0 "Providing incentives for companies to supply the state will surely increase their overall output. We will also receive the added benefit of covert production centers that will be invisible to the enemy."
 KSK_fascist8:0 "Expand the MIC"
 KSK_fascist8_desc:0 "Finally, we must expand our military-industrial complex. Truly, it is the most important part of the state, and our path to victory. We must focus our efforts on modernizing our arms production and funding this vital organ of the state."
 KSK_fascist9:0 "The Defender Radio"
 KSK_fascist9_desc:0 "The Defender has long been our chief newspaper, circulating our righteous message. Now, however, we must expand our audience to reach every part of our nation! We should appoint Gerald Winrod's son George to lead the effort and found the Defender Radio Station."

 KSK_fascist10_desc:0 "The Reverend has long been advocating for a return to the most important aspects of Christianity, those of defending against heresy and fighting against those who would see the church destroyed. Now, it is time that the people join our effort, and fight for the glory of God!"

 KSK_eisenhower1:0 "We Like Ike"
 KSK_eisenhower1_desc:0 "Dwight Eisenhower is, to say the least, our finest commander. He is also an advocate for an infantry-centered military, supported by artillery barrage. Clearly, he is the man who knows best about these things, so we should follow his lead."
 KSK_eisenhower2:0 "The Grease Gun"
 KSK_eisenhower2_desc:0 "The M3A1 is a proposed submachine gun to phase out the Thompson. Firing the same .45 ACP cartridge as the thompson, the M3 is cheaper to produce and lighter. We should begin research immediately to further understand how this gun will perform in the field."
 KSK_eisenhower3:0 "Steel Rain"
 KSK_eisenhower3_desc:0 "Let our enemies fear the might of our artillery units! Improving our battlefield saturation capabilities will prove extremely useful in routing the enemy!"

 KSK_eisenhower4_desc:0 "Equally important to the infantry is their support companies, which will provide much needed... well... support!"
 KSK_eisenhower5:0 "Modern Army"
 KSK_eisenhower5_desc:0 "Again we find ourselves in need of stronger infantry equipment! If we research new infantry weapons, we are sure to turn the tide in our favor."
 KSK_eisenhower6:0 "Standardized Arms Production"
 KSK_eisenhower6_desc:0 "Standardizing our weapons production means that we can produce our weapons faster and cheaper, which means we can overwhelm the enemy with our industry alone."
 KSK_eisenhower7:0 "Rigorous Training"
 KSK_eisenhower7_desc:0 "If we are to call our infantry the pride of our military, we must train them as such! What is especially important is their ability to learn from combat and survive in the harsh climates that are found all accross the state and the continent."
 KSK_chaffee1:0 "Chaffee's Armor Corps"
 KSK_chaffee1_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee Jr. is a Kansan calvalry officer, and a major proponent of armored warfare. He says that the days of infantry charges are over, and the time for rapid advances and armored assaults is coming. If he is right, we must modernize our army to fight these modern battles."
 KSK_chaffee2:0 "Prioritize Motorization"
 KSK_chaffee2_desc:0 "Chaffee, though a master on horseback, notes that motorized divisions would be integral to a fast assault."
 KSK_chaffee3:0 "Mechanization"
 KSK_chaffee3_desc:0 "Mechanized forces are the best of both worlds- the speed of a motorized company with the defense of an armored one. Let's get ready to research!"
 KSK_chaffee4:0 "Continue Army Tank Research"
 KSK_chaffee4_desc:0 "Obviously, if we are to wage armored warfare, we must have the latest tanks available. Prior to the collapse of the United States, the army was researching new models of tanks. We must continue this research and develop our own equipment!"
 KSK_chaffee5:0 "The M5 Stuart"
 KSK_chaffee5_desc:0 "Our research has finally bore fruit! We have devised the M5 Stuart, the pinnacle of our light tank designs. It is easy to manufacture, able to fight toe-to-toe with other light tanks, and most importantly, it is quite fast."
 KSK_chaffee6:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
 KSK_chaffee6_desc:0 "Producing enough tanks is a massive undertaking. However, if we form assembly lines to produce these tanks, our production speed will increase significantly."
 KSK_chaffee7:0 "Lightning War"
 KSK_chaffee_desc:0 "The most important aspect of armored warfare is speed, especially in our location. We are uniquely able to cross the plains at exceptional speed, and encircle divisions before they have a chance to notice. We must design our tanks around this principle- advance and encircle."
 KSK_army1:0 "Cross the Rockies"
 KSK_army1_desc:0 "The biggest obstacle to our expansion across the United States are the great Rocky Mountains. Our army simply will not be able to fight effectively, while our enemy will receive a massive home-field advantage. In order to counter this, it's time we established a mountaineer corps."
 KSK_army2:0 "Expand Our Doctrines"
 KSK_army2_desc:0 "Now that we have molded our equipment to match our doctrines, it is time to expound upon them. We will certainly find new doctrinal benefits if we continue."
 KSK_army3:0 "Experimental Weapons"
 KSK_army3_desc:0 "We have uncovered classified army documents detailing the possibility that we might weaponize the atom. Such a breakthrough would undoubtedly change warfare forever- which is why we must be the first to develop it."
 KSK_air1:0 "Air Capital of the World"
 KSK_air1_desc:0 "Wichita has been dubbed by some as "The Air Capital of the World". We will certainly live up to this name, for we know know ocean but the vast blue sky."
 KSK_air2:0 "Fighter Contracts"
 KSK_air2_desc:0 "While we may be at the front of the field in bomber production, we are falling behind in our fighter technology. We need to license new fighters and catch up to support our bombers!"
 KSK_air3:0 "Fighter Initiative"
 KSK_air3_desc:0 "The battlefield can be won by air superiority alone, and the best way to achieve this is with fighters."
 KSK_air4:0 "Escort Fighters"
 KSK_air4_desc:0 "While other nations may focus on small, agile fighters, we will focus our efforts on longe range, hard-hitting heavy fighters."
 KSK_air5:0 "Continue Bomber License"
 KSK_air5_desc:0 "Before the collapse, we had a contract with the federal government to produce several bombers. Now that the government no longer exists, there's no reason for us to stop this production. Let's put these bombers to good use!"
 KSK_air6:0 "CAS Effort"
 KSK_air6_desc:0 "Close Air Support can be the deciding factor in battle. Our infantry would certainly be grateful for air support, and it would allow us to make combined arms offensives."
 KSK_air7:0 "Strategic Bombers"
 KSK_air7_desc:0 "We can win wars without wasting a single infantryman. Bombs, not men, can cripple our enemies industry, destroying their ability to fight. We're going to bomb them back into the stone age!"
 KSK_air8:0 "Kansan Airborne"
 KSK_air8_desc:0 "If the air is our sea, then paratroopers will be our marines. Let our enemies fear the might of our airborne soldiers."
 KSK_air9:0 "Increased Fighter Production"
 KSK_air9_desc:0 "While it's easy to have visions of grandeur about air superiority, the truth is our air force is only as good as the workers who build our planes. The more planes we have in the air, the better."
 KSK_air10:0 "Ramp Up Bomber Production"
 KSK_air10_desc:0 "Imagine, our enemies think they are safe, when out of the skies roars the rolling thunder of our bombs. Their factories, leveled, their people, scattered. In one fell swoop, we have halted the enemy war machine. The only way this is possible, however is to produce enough bombers to cover the skies. We must ramp up our production immediately!"
 KSK_air11:0 "Amelia Earhart"
 KSK_air11_desc:0 "Amelia Earhart is one of Kansas' finest pilots, and perhaps one of the best in the world. Before the collapse, she had aspirations of circumnavigating the globe. However, her plans were stopped by the collapse. Instead, she has decided to become a pilot for our country."
 KSK_air12:0 "Into the Wild Blue Yonder"
 KSK_air12_desc:0 "The war in the air has changed forever, and lest we be left behind, we must refine our doctrines. What we teach our pilots will decide the fate of our air force, and our ability to win this vital war in the skies."
 KSK_conquest1:0 "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 KSK_conquest1_desc:0 "The time has come for us to expand our territory. Though our neighboring countries were once our fellow states, they are now unrecognizable masses of land ripe for the taking. We must be strong, be vigilant, if we are to fulfill our destiny."
 KSK_conquest2:0 "Fortify the Borders"
 KSK_conquest2_desc:0 "The first step to our conquests is to secure our frontiers. That starts with a line of bunkers that will protect us from foreign aggressors. These will be monuments to our strength, and protect us from any invader!"
 KSK_conquest3:0 "The Second Battle of Kansas City"
 KSK_conquest3_desc:0 "After the First Battle of Kansas City, our mission became clear- Secure Kansas City at all costs. Unifying the city would undoubtedly be a boost to our morale, as we have secured the eastern gate into our territory and squased the Missourian Bushwackers."
 KSK_conquest4:0 "Reclaim Denver"
 KSK_conquest4_desc:0 "Kansas territory once stretched all the way to Denver, and now is the time to regain our lost territory. Denver is the crown jewel of the rockies, and we must strike quickly if we are to secure it before the other vultures."
 KSK_conquest6:0 "Integrate Nebraska"
 KSK_conquest6_desc:0 "Though Nebraska might seem to hold little value for our state, it is always nice to expand your borders to provide buffer to your own territory. Besides, there is certainly industry in Nebraska that would be better served in the hands of Kansas."
 KSK_conquest5:0 "Take Oklahoma"
 KSK_conquest5_desc:0 "Expanding into Oklahoma is our best bet at containing Texas. The resources that we could gain there would certainly boost our aviation sector, and perhaps give us an armored fighting force to meet the Texans with. If we secure Oklahoma before they do, then we can rest easy that war will remain far from the Heart of Kansas."
 KSK_conquest7:0 "Unified Heartland"
 KSK_conquest7_desc:0 "After much fighting, the time has come to unify this broken heartland. For the most part, the occupied populace is at ease under Kansan rule, and they see no problem becoming part of a unified heartland. From now on, we no longer fight for Kansas, but for the entirety of Middle America."
