  dc.5.t:0 "The Second Constitutional Convention"
  dc.5.d:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the United States of America, our Constitution has come into question. Of the many things our founders planned for, the complete dissolution of the American Experiment was not one of them. To remedy this unrest, President Roosevelt has ordered a second constitutional convention to ratify our Constitution. We will be selecting certain amendments to revise and ratify."
  dc.5.a:0 "Ratification is our best option. Let's begin."
  dc.6.t:0 "An Offer from Washington D.C."
  dc.6.d:0 "Early this morning, we received correspondance from President Roosevelt. He wishes for us to unite into a singular nation, to better combat the coming storm. Should we accept, we would rejoin the federal government and be considered full citizens of the New United States. Should we refuse, however, it has been made clear that there will be war."
  dc.6.a:0 "Let the President know that we're coming home!"
  dc.6.b:0 "Absolutely not! Maryland will maintain her sovreignty!"
  dc.7.t:0 "Maryland Refuses!"
  dc.7.d:0 "Our letter was met with resistance from the leaders of Maryland, who argued that Maryland should maintain their sovreignty. We have made it abundantly clear that this will lead to war."
  dc.7.a:0 "Ready the troops, we march to war!"
  dc.8.t:0 "Maryland Accepts!"
  dc.8.d:0 "Maryland has accepted our offer, and is now integrated into the federal government. This will certainly mean that we will better project our power!"
  dc.8.a:0 "Wonderful, let us welcome our brothers and sisters home!"
##Focuses
 DC_constitution:0 "The Second Constitutional Convention"
 DC_constitution_desc:0 "The nation is in flames, broken to pieces. What used to unify us have now driven us apart, and now we have come to doubt the abilities of the founding fathers. We need to take a second look at our constitution, which clearly did not adequately protect us from this dissolution. Let us call a second constitutional convention to discuss these matters."
 DC_divided:0 "A Nation Divided"
 DC_divided_desc:0 "We've decided our constitution, now we need to sort out our political discourse. We are slowly tearing ourselves apart from the inside, and the sooner we sort out these issues the better."
 DC_democratic1:0 "Stay the Course"
 DC_democratic1_desc:0 "WIP"
 DC_democratic2:0 "Reorganize the Government"
 DC_democratic2_desc:0 "WIP"
 DC_democratic3:0 "Reconvene the House"
 DC_democratic3_desc:0 "WIP"
 DC_democratic4:0 "The Court is in Session"
 DC_democratic4_desc:0 "WIP"
 DC_democratic5:0 "Reconvene the Senate"
 DC_democratic5_desc:0 "WIP"
 DC_democratic6:0 "The State of the Union"
 DC_democratic6_desc:0 "WIP"
 DC_democratic7:0 "A Brand New Deal"
 DC_democratic7_desc:0 "During the State of the Union, President Roosevelt promised economic prosperity to those who would return to the union. To fulfill this promise, we must make our nation an economic power."
 DC_democratic8:0 "WPA"
 DC_democratic8_desc:0 "Before the collapse, President Roosevelt dreamed of a Worker's Progress Administration that would oversee the nation's recovery from the Great Depression. Let us make it a reality and establish a Federal WPA."
 DC_democratic9:0 "Social Security Act"
 DC_democratic9_desc:0 "A prosperous society never neglects those in need. We need to protect those among us who are of old age, victims of industrial accidents, the handicapped, and the poor. Our society will be a just one, and it starts with the Social Security Act."
 DC_democratic10:0 "Revive the MIC"
 DC_democratic10_desc:0 "Our military-industrial complex is the lifeblood of our armed forces, and as such it should be treated with the utmost importance. There are threats all around us, and it would seem that our first line of defense is the abilities of the Military Industrial Complex. Therefore, let us fund its expansion!"
 DC_democratic11:0 "Job Creation"
 DC_democratic11_desc:0 "Washington D.C. is a large city, but a city nonetheless. We cannot hope to compete in manpower with the likes of New York or California. Our only hope is to draw in immigrants from all over the country. We can certainly do that through the creation of jobs, as there will be millions of former federal employees looking for new work."
 DC_democratic12:0 "D.C. Public Works"
 DC_democratic12_desc:0 "The National Mall is already a well-developed region, but our transit around the city has been hindered by now-blocked roads leading into Virginia and Maryland. We have the opportunity to revitalize our infrastrucure, even create a national metro under the city. This would certainly lead to economic prosperity."
 DC_democratic13:0 "One Step Ahead"
 DC_democratic13_desc:0 "Though the MIC is certainly a strength, if we don't begin fortifying the national mall, our nation's most important monuments may be lost to marauding forces from our surrounding states. Therefore, a federal program for defense contracting has been proposed, which would help us rapidly develop our defenses around the Capitol."
 DC_democratic14:0 "Back In Action"
 DC_democratic14_desc:0 "After many months, our efforts have finally paid off. The New Deal will be an amazing success that will lead not only Washington D.C., but every state under our control, to prosperity. Let us congratulate ourselves and look to the future, where we will finally decide our true destiny."
 DC_democratic15:0 "Approach Maryland"
 DC_democratic15_desc:0 "It is time for us to approach Maryland. We are going to gamble on their support, where they will either accept and join us, or refuse and be invaded."
 DC_democratic16:0 "Gunboat Diplomacy"
 DC_democratic16_desc:0 "Now that we have a foothold in Maryland, it's time for us to think about our foreign policy. Let us turn to an aggressive approach, where all nations will kneel before us. Let the states fear the approach of their federal government!"
 DC_democratic17:0 "Occupy Delaware"
 DC_democratic17_desc:0 "Delaware might be small, but they are traitors nonetheless. We must welcome them back into the fold through force. It should be fairly easy to conquer such a small nation, especially after the integration of Maryland."
 DC_democratic18:0 "David vs. Goliath"
 DC_democratic18_desc:0 "Virginia will undoubtedly be one of the most difficult nations to conquer. They possess a significant army and industry, and our war will be nothing short of intense. Nevertheless, we must march onwards to capture Richmond, for the spoils of war will be even greater than we can imagine!"
 DC_democratic19:0 "The Pennsylvania Matter"
 DC_democratic19_desc:0 "Pennsylvania lies to our north, and they remain a thorn in our side. Their industry is great, and their resources even greater, which is why they must be reintegrated. We cannot allow such a powerhouse to remain on our borders. If we fail to strike first, then they will surely do so before us!"
 DC_democratic20:0 "Seize West Virginia"
 DC_democratic20_desc:0 "The Mountains of West Virginia, though treacherous, hide large deposits of oil. The capture of these fields would fuel our nation for years to come, and if we are to grow our armed forces, then West Virginia must be reintegrated."
 DC_democratic21:0 "Subdue New Jersey"
 DC_democratic21_desc:0 "After our capture of Pennsylvania, our eyes turned to New Jersey. Their industrial capacity grows by the day, and while it might be less than ours, their factories would make a fine addition to the republic."
 DC_democratic22:0 "March South"
 DC_democratic22:0 "The Carolinas are our next logical step after the reintegration of Virginia. Let us march along the coast until they are brought to heel!"
 DC_fascist1:0 "Battle of Pennsylvania Avenue"
 DC_fascist1_desc:0 "We have on standby several members of the American Legion and rogue elements of the Army. We have the opportunity to strike at the heart of the Republic, and root out that bastard Roosevelt. Should we be successful, we will celebrate the Battle of Pennsylvania Avenue for years to come!"
 DC_fascist2:0 "Habeas Corpus Suspension"
 DC_fascist2_desc:0 "The writ of Habeas Corpus mandates that every person must be given a trial. Given the state of our justice system, this is something that will take far too long. It would be easier for our armed forces to decide who's guilty. Let's suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus, and begin rounding up traitors!"
 DC_fascist4:0 "Appoint Hoover"
 DC_fascist4_desc:0 "There is no intelligence officer quite like J. Edgar Hoover. A veteran of the FBI, this man would make a fine Director of the FBI. With his help, we can modernize our intelligence network to better suit our nation's needs."
 DC_fascist5:0 "COINTELPRO"
 DC_fascist5_desc:0 "The Counter Intelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, is a program designed to root out political opponents and prevent them from gaining traction. After our recent victories, this is especially important, as we cannot allow dissenters to operate on our soil. Let's approve the program and get to work!"
 DC_fascist6:0 "Recruit McCarthy"
 DC_fascist6_desc:0 "Joseph McCarthy, former Senator from Montana, is an interesting man. A virulent anti-communist, he has been staunchly against the actions of the President, accusing him of being a closeted communist. This man is rabid for his country, and is always willing to hunt down any trace of communism. This man puts the scare in Red Scare, and we need him to get to work!"
 DC_fascist7:0 "Round Up Communists"
 DC_fascist7_desc:0 "McCarthy's efforts have been successful, and we've managed to round up what we believe to be the remnants of communism in the Capitol region. We'll put them through a show trial and give them a swift execution, but they cannot be allowed to spread their harmful ideology."
 DC_fascist8:0 "Rally the Legion"
 DC_fascist8_desc:0 "The time has finally come for us to rise from the ashes of instability. We will be holding a press conference on the steps of the Capitol, where we will announce the new leader of the United States. Thousands of people will show up to support us on this glorious day, which is surely a sign that our political woes are over!"
 DC_fascist9:0 "Caesar Marches Home"
 DC_fascist9_desc:0 "Douglas MacArthur is a legend amongst our army. This is a man who looks war in the face and spits on it. Some of the men have started to call him the American Caesar, as they think that he could be the one to reclaim the former United States. Should we contact him to lead the nation to victory?"
 DC_fascist10:0 "For God and Country!"
 DC_fascist10_desc:0 "Alvin Owsley, leader of the American Legion, is certainly a viable candidate for President. He was integral in the plot to overthrow Roosevelt, and we are certainly in his debt. Owsley has recently been openly critical of our Armed Forces, arguing that there are underpaid, underequipped, and undervalued. He promises to revitalize the military and give our soldiers the treatment they deserve."
