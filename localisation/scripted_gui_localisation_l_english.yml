 ACA_description:0 "Acadia was a colony of New France in northeastern North America which included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and Maine to the Kennebec River. During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia. It was eventually divided into British colonies. The first capital of Acadia was established in 1605 as Port-Royal. A British force from Virginia attacked and burned down the town in 1613, but it was later rebuilt nearby, where it remained the longest-serving capital of French Acadia until the British Siege of Port Royal in 1710. There were six colonial wars in a 74-year period in which British interests tried to capture Acadia, starting with King William's War in 1689. French troops from Quebec, Acadians, the Wabanaki Confederacy, and French priests continually raided New England settlements along the border in Maine during these wars. Acadia was conquered in 1710 during Queen Anne's War, while New Brunswick and much of Maine remained contested territory. Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton remained under French control, as agreed under Article XIII of the Treaty of Utrecht. \n \n Major Cities include: \n Halifax \n Charlottetown \n Fredericton"

 form_app_desc:0 "Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York State to northern Alabama and Georgia. Since its recognition as a distinctive region in the late 19th century, Appalachia has been a source of enduring myths and distortions regarding the isolation, temperament, and behavior of its inhabitants. Early 20th century writers often engaged in yellow journalism focused on sensationalistic aspects of the region's culture, such as moonshining and clan feuding, and often portrayed the region's inhabitants as uneducated and prone to impulsive acts of violence. While endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with poverty. Appalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a coonskin cap and buckskin clothing, and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped powder horn. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than Daniel Boone (1734–1820), a long hunter and surveyor instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from "civilization" by high mountain ridges, and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century."
 form_the_aus_desc:0 "In the hurricane that was the Second American Civil War, the American Union State cemented itself among the frontrunners for the 'shining city on the hill' taking root in much of the former Confederate lands. Lead by the infamous Huey Long, it's founded on equality for the people inside the jurisdiction of the state. If it can solidify its independence, it's government's main focus will be centered on the depressed agricultural regions in the south, hoping to increase its economy and bring prosperity to all of its citizens. It's unknown how well the new centralized economy will work or if the wealth redistribution will also affect political elites. Below Huey Long are four other individuals. Gerald Smith is a clergyman that leads the 'Share Our Wealth' program. The second is Father Charles Coughlin, a Canadian-American catholic priest from Ontario who hosts a weekly radio program known for it's racist and anti-semitic preachings. Third is WIlliam Dudley Pelley who leads the authoritarian faction and often criticizes Long for being too lenient. Fourth and finally is Charles Lindbergh who represents the less popular democratic and moderate portions of the party. \n Major Cities Include: \n Raleigh | Charlotte \n Columbia | Charleston \n Atlanta | Mobile \n Tallahassee | Jacksonville \n Jackson | Little Rock \n Baton Rouge | New Orleans"

We thought that, after the War of 1812, the Americans were done interfering with our country - we were wrong. All at one, everything came toppling down and everyone split apart. The French in Quebec and the British in Columbia, we were set back to 1867. However, this did not stop us. With time, our economy was nurtured back to health with our firm grasp of power inside our borders; now the rest of the former Canadian territories recognize our supremacy and wish to reunite under our control and, once more, fly the flag of the Maple Leaf.

 form_ECC_desc:0 "The territories of present-day North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee were all under the Colonial Carolina flag until its breakup by the Lords Proprietors in 1712, which saw South Carolina become a separate colony. Later, after the formation of the United States, Tennessee would be forfeited to the federal government. These lands feature diverse terrain, from the foothills in the piedmont, the arable land in the tidewater, to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Mississippi River in the west. These variations in terrain allowed for a diverse economy, boasting large industries in agriculture and textiles. Although the division between the northern and southern governments became complete in 1712, both colonies remained in the hands of the same group of proprietors. A rebellion against the proprietors broke out in 1719 which led to the appointment of a royal governor for South Carolina in 1720. After nearly a decade in which the British government sought to locate and buy out the proprietors, both North and South Carolina became royal colonies in 1729. Now that we've reunited the states, we must strive to carve a name out along with our former lands. \nMajor cities include \n Raleigh | Charlotte \n Charleston | Columbia \n Nashville | Memphis."
 form_CGE_desc:0 "Before the foundation of the United States, the region of Colonial Georgia - whose land now lies in Mississippi and Alabama as well - was a garrison state between the Thirteen Colonies and Spanish Florida. We had the arms and defences to ward off any foreign evils. After the collapse of the United States, the three original states are now independent. Once more, we have claimed our land back from what was unrightfully taken in 1802 by Congress. It’s time to rearm, rebuild, and reclaim what was lost and shout to the heavens that we, too, can be a source of influence. The last of the Thirteen Colonies to be established by Great Britain it had the closest ties to the former colonizer of any of the colonies. When violence broke out between the Revolutionaries and the British army, the Georgian colonists were divided on how to act about it. It's establishment was primarily based on a need for a buffer state or 'garrison' state between the colonies and Spanish Florida. Because of it's establishment as a border state to defend against threats, the farmers were expected to be able to take up arms and hold a defense. Due to this, slavery was prohibited in the colony until 1751 when Georgia became a royal colony. \nMajor Cities Include \n Atlanta | Jackson \n Montgomery | Birmingham"
 form_GRL_desc:0 "Despite having one of the largest colonies at the time, France was forced to put Louisiana into the hands of foreign powers. The British and Spanish took off a few inches of land after the Seven Years’ War and the U.S. - after gaining independence - purchased the rest from a desperate Napoleon. Since 1803, the land has been enveloped by American states and territories. Now that those states are protected by a federal government no longer, the French lands are ripe for the taking. Following our European ancestors, we will take back the land that was stolen from us and conquer Central North American where our land stood and will stand again. French Louisiana was an administrative district of New France. It originally covered the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. Louisiana included two regions, now known as upper Louisiana (la Haute-Louisiane) which began north of the Arkansas river, and Lower Louisiana (Basse-Louisiane). As a result of the loss of the 7 Years' War, France had to cede the eastern part of New France, which left the Louisiana portion only which was ceded to the United States in 1803. \nMagor Cities Include \n Baton Rouge | New Orleans \n Little Rock | Oklahoma City \n Jefferson City | Topeka \n Denver | Des Moines \n Lincoln | Pierre \n Minneapolis | Bismarck \n Helena | Cheyenne"
 form_CNY_desc:0 "The Province of New York (1664–1776) was a British proprietary colony and later royal colony on the northeast coast of North America. As one of the middle Thirteen Colonies, New York achieved independence and worked with the others to found the United States. n 1664, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch Province of New Netherland in America was awarded by Charles II of England to his brother James, Duke of York. James raised a fleet to take it from the Dutch and the Governor surrendered to the English fleet without recognition from the Dutch West Indies Company. The province was renamed for the Duke of York, as its proprietor. When the English arrived, the Dutch colony somewhat vaguely included claims to all of the present U.S. states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Vermont, along with inland portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine in addition to eastern Pennsylvania. Much of this land was soon reassigned by the crown, leaving the territory of the modern State of New York, including the valleys of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers, and future Vermont. /nMajor Cites include: \n   New York City | Albany \n   Montpelier | Columbus \n    Indianapolis | Chicago"

Our mission is to liberate all of those oppressed by the ruling class, the people that grow fat on the hard work and labor of others. United we stand under syndicalism, against capitalism.

By some miracle, they were defeated and the Union took back power. Now, exactly 75 years later, history repeats itself. The great power of the Confederate States of America rises once more from the ashes of the so-called “Union” that won the first war. With no overall government, there is no northern power to stop our freedoms. We, as the successors of old, will prove to the other states that the South is the dominant power of the North American region. The Confederacy was formed on February 8, 1861, by the seven secessionist slave states. All seven of the states were located in the southeasternmost region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture—particularly cotton—and a plantation system that relied upon slaves of African descent for labor. \nMajor Cities Include: \n    Tallahassee | Atlanta \n    Columbia | Raleigh \n   Richmond | Montgomery \n    Jackson | Baton Rouge \n    Austin | Phoenix \n   Jefferson City | Charleston \n    Little Rock | Nashville"

With our beliefs, we shall shine as a beacon of hope before all the failures which have spawned from the collapse of the Union and all our people, holding strong in their beliefs, will be the role models of the future for all North and Central Americans, Mormon or not. The Mormon Exodus was a humiliating time in our history and we ought to take back our place in the world. There's no excuse for how we were treated and it left us weaker than before.

It lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie in the former United States and east of the Rocky Mountains in the U.S. and Canada. The region is about 500 mi (800 km) east to west and 2,000 mi (3,200 km) north to south. Much of the region was home to American bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid/late-19th century. It has an area of approximately 500,000 sq mi (1,300,000 sq km). While the great plains nation not being very defensable, we do have a large population and plenty of land for farming. With our excess of food, we can export food to support our growing industrial sector. Regardless, we will do whatever necessary to preserve our soveringty and keep our people free of subjugation for as long as possible. \nMajor Cities Include:\n    Topeka | Wichita \n   Oklahoma City | Tulsa \n    Lincoln | Omaha \n    Rapid City | Fargo"

Since the colonial times, we were at the forefront of the American politics, in fact, it was within New England that the revolution began, and it was in Massachusetts where New English Blood and Tea were spilled beforehand. Our six small states, even with our damned self-righteous neighbors to the Southwest and the North, have always stuck together and been united in brotherhood. We are the American Yankee culture, and we always will be, so now, to protect said culture from Quebec or New York or whoever may mean us harm, we shall form our own union, a new one. God Bless New England. \nMajor Cities Include:\n   Portland | Concord \n   Montpelier | Boston \n  Hartford | Providence"

Taking place on the West Coast, the Pacific States of America quickly seized control of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. After this, they began to push inwards towards the Central United States. Now with the Federal Government gone, the Pacific States of America can be realized. Consolodation of power on the West Coast would create a power that is able to project itself across the globe with the Pacific Fleet of the former United States. It's geography makes it easily defensable with the ocean in the west, forests in the north, deserts in the south, and desert mountains in the east. To take over this nation would be no easy task and their army makes it no easier. To stomp this nation back off the continent would be a feat that we cannot allow to be achieved. The Pacific States shall be sat on the coast for centuries to come, bringing liberty to all in their reach. The Pacific States of America shall live on and remain united. \nMajor Cities Include: \n   San Francisco | Portland \n   Seattle | Anchorage"

Sights claimed that two-thirds of the politicians he polled favored the idea. The New York Times, although skeptical, covered the plan in significant detail. In addition, the American vice president at the time, John Nance Garner IV, was a big supporter of carving Texas into new states. The main support behind Texlahoma was to increase road infrastructure as the automobile became more and more popular. The poor infrastructure sparked outcry for the states to unite. Sadly, it did not come to fruition, but today we can change that. With the formation of Texlahoma, we can project power and gain more renoun on the North American content. With the strength that comes with the unification of the two states, we may be able to plunge deeper into the continent and realize greater ambitions. If that is to be achieved, our people must be united together first. We must bring those around us to heel as we grow in power. \nMajor Cities Include: \n   Austin | Houston \n   San Antonio | Dallas-Fort Worth \n    Tulsa | Oklahoma City"

Now, more than three-hundred years later, we have been reduced to nothing but divided populations fighting among each other. We must rally the people again against our greater threats and increase our strength. Now is the time to revive the old tradition and remind the American people where they truly came from. The Thirteen Colonies rebelled once against a great power and they shall fight once more under a single flag! \nMajor Cities Include: \n Atlanta \n Columbia \n Raleigh \n Richmond \n Washington D.C. \n Baltimore \n Philadelphia \n Trenton \n Albany \n Hartford \n Providence \n Boston \n Concord \n Augusta"
 form_UDU_desc:0 "After 1889, the Dakota Territory was split in two: North and South. The cultures, the trade routes, everything; the two states were in a peaceful rivalry with each other. That was until the federal government collapsed under the weight of the Great Depression. Every state - every man - for themselves, the Americas are now in chaos. If either of us wish to survive this new era, we must put our grudges aside, albeit temporarily, and defend ourselves as one united front. From Bismarck to Pierre, the people of Dakota will rise from the burning hell and wield the flaming sword of a rising power!\nMajor cities include: \n   Bismarck \n   Pierre"
 form_USA_desc:0 "Well. How the mighty fall. The strongest nation in the Americas, the republic, the American Experiment, gone with the wind. With the Depression came the Collapse, with the Collapse, a nation over a century old suddenly exploded into 50 new ones. The USA was the hegemonic state of the New World, especially with the Monroe Doctrine. Now, we’ve finally brought the states back under a single flag. We have work to do, but by God, it is time to start our restoration back to our former status. The disunion was the darkest hour in American history. This, however, will be our very finest hour, and today's date will go down in history as the States become United once again. Though only a fraction of what we once were, we will claim our former lands and reclaim what was once ours. Our nation is now solidified once more, but we still have lots of work to do. The Union's collapse was unfortunate, but we shall not repeat history. We must build a nation out of our own ashes with a stronger government. The United States will rise back to it's former power and grow even further. The fight will be long and hard, but Patriots have never been the type to give up against a stronger enemy."
