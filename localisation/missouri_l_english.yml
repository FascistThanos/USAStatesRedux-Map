missouri.1.t:0 "Missourian Victory!"
missouri.1.d:0 "Earlier today, border conflicts along the Kansas-Missouri border culminated in an all out skirmish between the two states. After intense fighting in Kansas City, the Missouri national guard was victorious! Jubilant soldiers gathered in front of the Power and Light building to organize a small parade, much to the dismay of Kansan spectators."
missouri.1.a:0 "That'll teach those Jayhawkers to mess with Missouri!"
missouri.3.t:0 "The Kansas City Referendum"
missouri.3.d:0 "Following the skirmishes along the border, Kansas has decided to propose a referendum to the people of Kansas City. The votes have all been counted, and it seems that Kansas City has voted to be unified under Kansas. Should we accept the result?"
missouri.3.a:0 "We must follow the will of the people."
missouri.3.b:0 "Absolutely not! They obviously tampered with the vote!"
